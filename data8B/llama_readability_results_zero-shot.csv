At its core, aging is a result of the gradual decline in physiological function over time, leading to increased susceptibility to age-related diseases and decreased quality of life. This decline is thought to be driven by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, which collectively contribute to the accumulation of cellular damage and dysregulation of various biological processes.

Research has identified several key mechanisms underlying human aging, including telomere shortening, epigenetic alterations, and proteostatic imbalance. The interplay between these factors leads to a decline in cellular homeostasis, resulting in the manifestation of age-related phenotypes. Furthermore, the exposome, or cumulative exposure to environmental stressors, also plays a critical role in modulating aging processes.
