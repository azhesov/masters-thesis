In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on.

The era of prehistory was a time of great discovery, and human beings found many ways to survive and thrive in the world around them. As they moved out of Africa and into other parts of the world, they encountered many new animals, plants, and landscapes. To make sense of their new environments, humans developed tools and other technologies that helped them adapt to their surroundings. They made stone and bone tools, such as knives and scrapers, which they used to hunt and gather food. They also developed more sophisticated tools, like the bow and arrow, which allowed them to hunt from a distance and protect themselves from predators. As humans continued to explore and settle new lands, they began to develop more complex societies and cultures, which laid the foundation for the civilizations that followed.

Prehistory refers to the time period before written records existed. This means we don’t have written accounts of events, but we can still learn about it. Archaeologists use tools like excavation and analysis to piece together the past. Excavation involves carefully uncovering artifacts, which are objects that tell us about the people who made them. Analysis is like putting together a puzzle, where archaeologists examine the objects and their context to figure out what they mean. This can be like trying to reconstruct a story from a few dropped words. Just as the bean, coal, and straw tried to figure out how they ended up together, archaeologists try to understand the relationships between artifacts and the people who used them. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the earliest humans and their ways of life, even if we don’t have written records. It’s like finding a piece of a puzzle and trying to fit it into the bigger picture. (199 words)

Prehistory is the time before written records. Before that, people didn’t leave behind written documents or books to tell us about their lives. We can only guess what they were doing and how they lived by looking at the things they made, like tools and houses. 

The coal in the fire and the bean in the pan, and the straw on the ground were all worried about their fate. So are the things we find in the prehistoric era, like the ancient tools and houses. We wonder what kind of people made them and how they used them. 

Just as the hot air from the furnace is used to dry the veneer, we use clues from the past to learn about the people who lived before us. We try to imagine what their lives were like and how they made the things we find.

Imagine prehistory, a time long before written words were used. It's like a secret world that existed without leaving behind a trail of records. The earth was a vastly different place, with giant creatures roaming the land and humans just starting to appear. Our ancestors lived in small groups, relying on hunting and gathering to survive. They had no written language, so all their stories and knowledge were passed down through word of mouth. It's as if a big fire was lit, and they were all sitting around it, sharing tales and experiences, but none of it was recorded. The past was a mystery, and it's only through the study of artifacts, like old tools and bones, that we can try to piece together what life was like back then.

Prehistory is the time before writing was invented, when our ancestors didn’t leave behind written records. This period stretches from the emergence of the first humans, approximately two million years ago, to the development of writing, around 5,000 years ago. During this time, humans learned to adapt to their environments, controlling fire, hunting and gathering food, and settling in villages. The first tools, made from stone, wood, and bone, helped early humans to survive and thrive. As populations grew, trade and cultural exchange increased, and people began to develop complex societies. The prehistoric period is divided into three main stages: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. Each stage is characterized by significant technological advancements, such as the invention of the wheel, the domestication of animals, and the development of agriculture. The prehistoric period may seem distant and mysterious, but it laid the foundation for the modern world we know today.

skeptical - having doubts about the truth or accuracy of something
relic - something that is left behind after something or someone is gone
archaeologists - people who study past cultures by digging up and examining their remains
skeleton - the framework of a body, made up of bones

Prehistory is a mysterious period that is difficult to understand. It is the time before written records were kept, so we have to rely on artifacts to learn about the people who lived during that time. Many people are skeptical about the stories that we tell about prehistory, because they are based on incomplete evidence. But archaeologists have discovered many interesting relics that help us piece together what life was like back then. They have found the skeletons of ancient people, which give us clues about their diets, lifestyles, and even their physical characteristics.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Prehistory
Period of human existence before written records
Ancient societies
Artifacts (tools, relics, etc.)
Archaeology
Cultural developments
Primitive communities

Prehistory, the period of human existence before written records, is a mysterious time in the evolution of ancient societies. During this period, early humans lived in primitive communities, and their lives were vastly different from ours. By studying the artifacts left behind, archaeologists can piece together the history of these early cultures. Tools, such as stone knives and wooden spears, were essential to their survival, while relics, such as pottery and jewelry, reveal the cultural developments of these ancient communities. Archaeologists carefully analyze these findings to understand the lives of our ancestors. As they excavate sites, they uncover evidence of the people who lived there, providing a glimpse into the past. By studying prehistory, we can gain a deeper understanding of how our world has evolved and the significant cultural developments",9.6,65.76,12.0,12.0,11.57,9.52,5.16,11.0

In the prehistoric period, humans lived in caves, which provided a natural shelter. But if the cave was not well-ventilated, the air inside could become hot and stale. The people used fire to cook their food, which helped to purify the air. A coal would say, 'I fortunately escaped from the fire, but if I had not, I would have been burnt to ashes.' Similarly, a bean would say, 'If the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy.' A piece of straw might say, 'But would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' This shows that even in prehistoric times, humans were concerned about their well-being and took steps to improve their living conditions. The prehistoric people also used natural resources, such as wood and water, to make tools and shelter. By doing so, they were able to survive and thrive in their environment. This shows that humans have always been resource",7.9,75.64,9.7,9.3,9.85,7.25,4.64,11.0

Prehistory is the period of time before written records were kept. This is why it is called prehistory. It started millions of years ago when humans first appeared on Earth and ended about 5,000 years ago when writing was first developed. The earliest humans lived in caves and hunted for food. They made tools from rocks and sticks. As time went on, humans learned to control fire, which helped them cook their food and stay warm. They also learned to make clothes and shelter from animal hides and branches. 

The prehistoric humans moved to new lands and developed new tools and techniques. They started to farm the land and grow their own food. This changed their lives and helped them to settle in one place. They also made pottery and developed their own languages. The prehistoric humans were very resourceful and adapted to their surroundings. They survived and thrived in a world without written records. Their stories and traditions were passed down through generations by word of mouth.

Prehistory was a time before written records. People and their ways of life were not documented. Therefore, understanding prehistory is challenging. The past was like a burning fire on the hearth, and archaeologists are trying to gather the hot coals and pieces of ash to form a picture of what life was like. They excavate sites and collect artifacts, which are objects made by early humans. The artifacts are then dried and examined. This process is like taking a veneer from a log and placing it in a dry room to be preserved. The hot air from the furnace is like the blower in the dry room, which keeps the air moving. Just as the temperature in the dry room is kept at 165°, archaeologists are careful to preserve the artifacts in a controlled environment, usually in a museum. The goal is to understand the past, to see how people lived and what they did. It is a challenging task, but with patience and care, archaeologists can reconstruct",7.7,76.25,9.5,9.7,9.88,7.49,4.65,11.0
