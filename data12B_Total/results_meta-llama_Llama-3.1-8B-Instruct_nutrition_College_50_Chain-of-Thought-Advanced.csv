Nutrition is the study of how the body uses food for energy, growth, and maintenance. It involves understanding the chemical and physical changes that occur in the body as it digests and absorbs nutrients from food. Nutrition plays a critical role in maintaining good health, preventing chronic diseases, and supporting physical performance. A well-balanced diet that includes a variety of foods from all food groups is essential for optimal nutrition. This involves consuming adequate amounts of macronutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, as well as micronutrients, like vitamins and minerals.
