Prehistory is a long, long time ago. Before people had clocks and calendars, before they even knew how to write. Our ancestors lived back then. They were hunters and gatherers. They found food in the wild, like fruits, nuts, and animals. They made their own homes, like caves and tents.

Our ancestors were very clever. They made tools from rocks and sticks. They used these tools to help them survive. Some tools were sharp and helped them cut and hunt. Others were flat and helped them make fires. They also made clothes from animal hides and plants.

Prehistory is a mystery to us. We don't know much about our ancestors' lives. But we can learn from the tools and homes they left behind. These discoveries help us understand how people lived a long, long time ago. They show us that our ancestors were strong and resourceful. They adapted to their environment and made the best of what they had. We can learn from",3.0,88.33,5.3,8.6,6.6,7.39,3.05,3.769230769230769

Prehistory is the time before people wrote down their history. It's a very long time ago, even before our ancestors wore clothes. During this time, people lived in small groups, hunted animals for food, and gathered fruits and berries. They used stones, bones, and wood to make tools, like knives and spears, to help them survive. 
As time passed, people learned to make fire, which helped them cook their food and stay warm. They also discovered how to grow their own food, like crops and vegetables. This led to the development of villages, where people could live together more safely. 
The earliest humans, like cavemen, left behind clues about their lives. These clues include pictures on walls, tools, and even fossils of animals they hunted. Archaeologists, or scientists who study the past, look at these clues to learn more about prehistory. They can figure out what people ate, how they lived, and even what they believed in.

Prehistory is a long, long time ago. It was before people had written words. So, we can't read about it in books like we can with history. That's why we call it ""prehistory."" People lived a long time ago, and they didn't leave behind many clues about their lives. But archaeologists, or people who dig in the ground, have found some things that tell us about them. They found old tools made of stone and bones. They even found old homes made of sticks and mud. We can learn a little bit about how people lived by looking at these things. We can imagine what it would have been like to live a long time ago. Maybe you have seen pictures of dinosaurs. Well, prehistory is even older than that! People have been living on Earth for a very, very long time. We are still learning about it, and it's very exciting! Who knows what secrets we might discover next?

Prehistory was a very long time ago, even before your grandparents were born. It was from about 2 million to 5,000 years ago. During this time, there were no cars, no phones, no computers, and no televisions. People didn't even have homes like we do today. They lived in caves or made their own homes from sticks and mud. They hunted for food and gathered fruits and berries from the forest. They wore animal hides for clothes. The people of prehistory were very skilled and made tools from rocks and sticks. They also made art like paintings on the wall and carvings on stones. They told stories and passed them down to their children. They were very good at surviving in the wild and taking care of their families. We can learn a lot about them by studying their homes, tools, and art that have been left behind.

Prehistory is the time before written records existed. It's like a big mystery. Archaeologists, or treasure hunters of the past, try to figure out what life was like back then. They dig up old bones, tools, and other things that people left behind. From these discoveries, they can imagine what life was like for the people who lived during that time. They learn about the food they ate, the clothes they wore, and the homes they lived in. They even find out what games they played and what stories they told. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the people who came before us and how they lived their lives. It's like putting together a big puzzle, and every new discovery helps us see a clearer picture of the past. We can be like archaeologists and explore the world around us to see what secrets it holds. Who knows what mysteries we might uncover?

Use the term 'caveman' to keep it simple and engaging.
A long, long time ago, before people had written records, our ancestors lived in a time called prehistory. These people were called cavemen. They lived in caves and made their own homes out of animal hides and branches. They hunted for food, gathering berries, fruits, and animals to eat. Cavemen were very good at making tools, like sharp stones and sticks, to help them survive. They also made fire to keep warm and cook their food. They wore animal hides for clothes and made shoes out of rawhide. Cavemen had to be very brave and clever to survive in a world without modern tools and comforts. They had to adapt to the changing seasons and find ways to protect themselves from wild animals and harsh weather. Despite the challenges, cavemen were able to thrive and pass on their skills to their children. They laid the foundation for the people who would come after them, shaping the course of human",6.1,74.9,7.9,8.8,7.69,8.92,4.01,5.777777777777778

Here is a paragraph about prehistory:

A long, long time ago, before anyone could write, people lived on our planet. These people are called prehistoric. They didn't have any of the things we use today, like cars, computers, or even paper. They lived in caves, in tents, or in small villages. They hunted animals for food and gathered fruits and vegetables. They made their own tools, like stone knives and clubs, to help them survive. Prehistoric people were very resourceful and clever. They learned how to make fires, which helped them stay warm and cook their food. They also learned how to make clothes and shelter. We can learn about these people by studying the things they left behind, like fossils, rocks, and old tools. By understanding their lives, we can appreciate how far we've come and how much we've changed over time. Prehistoric people lived a",5.5,76.52,8.2,9.0,7.86,9.61,3.71,5.777777777777778

The prehistoric period is very, very long ago. It began when humans first appeared on Earth. Before that, the Earth was home to animals and plants, but no humans. Humans evolved over time from a type of ape. They learned to walk on two legs, make tools, and live in groups. The prehistoric period was a time of big change. Humans moved to different parts of the world, and they began to farm the land. They hunted animals for food, and they made shelters to live in. As humans lived and learned, they created new tools and ways to survive. The prehistoric period lasted for thousands and thousands of years. It finally ended when humans began to write down their stories and histories, and that is when history began. So, the prehistoric period was a time when humans were just starting to live on Earth and figure out how to survive. It was a very important time in human history.

Prehistory is a long, long time ago. It was before people had written words to record their lives. That's why we don't have written stories about it. Instead, we learn about it by looking at old things that people made or left behind. We can see pictures on old rocks, in caves, and on pottery. We can also find old bones of animals and people. These things tell us about the people who lived a long time ago. They show us what they ate, where they lived, and how they dressed. We can even learn about the tools they used and the homes they made. Some of the old tools are like stones with sharp edges. Others are like sticks with points on the end. We can also see old homes made of sticks and mud. By looking at these old things, we can imagine what life was like for the people who lived a long time ago.
