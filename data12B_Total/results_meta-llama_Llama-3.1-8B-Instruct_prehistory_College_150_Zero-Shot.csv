Prehistory, often considered the period preceding written records, spans from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing systems. This vast era is characterized by the development of complex societies, technological advancements, and significant cultural transformations. Archaeologists and anthropologists have pieced together the narrative of prehistory through the excavation of artifacts, fossil records, and oral traditions. The period is typically divided into distinct phases, such as the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each marked by significant milestones in human evolution and technological progress. By examining the remnants of past civilizations, researchers can infer the ways in which human societies adapted to their environments, interacted with one another, and ultimately gave rise to the complex, written societies of modern times. The study of prehistory offers valuable insights into the human condition, allowing us to appreciate the trajectory of human history and the intricate web of cultural and technological advancements that have shaped our world.

**Paleolithic** humans lived from approximately 2.6 million years ago to 10,000 years ago. During this time, humans were hunter-gatherers who relied on their ability to adapt to different environments in order to survive. Their tools were primarily made from stone, and were used for tasks such as hunting, gathering, and self-defense. These early humans were able to migrate to different parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, and Europe, in search of resources and more favorable climates. The **Paleolithic** era is often divided into three sub-periods: the Lower **Paleolithic**, the Middle **Paleolithic**, and the Upper **Paleolithic**.

The prehistoric era is the period of human history prior to the advent of written records. It spans from the emergence of the first hominins, such as Homo habilis, around 2.8 million years ago, to the development of civilizations that left behind written records, approximately 5,000 years ago. During this time, early humans evolved from primates, developed tools, and began to adapt to various environments. The prehistoric era is often divided into several distinct periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic era, also known as the Old Stone Age, saw the development of early stone tools and the emergence of modern humans, Homo sapiens. The Mesolithic era, or Middle Stone Age, saw the development of more sophisticated tools and the expansion of human populations. The Neolithic era, or New Stone Age, saw the development of agriculture and the emergence of complex societies.

Prehistory is the period of time before recorded history, spanning from the emergence of the first humans around 2.5 million years ago to the invention of writing, which marks the beginning of recorded history, around 3000 BCE. During this time, early humans developed complex social structures, hunted and gathered for food, and eventually began to domesticate plants and animals. The development of stone tools and the use of fire marked significant milestones in human progress. The rise of Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, and other ancient human species also occurred during this period. As human societies grew and became more complex, they began to leave behind evidence of their existence in the form of artifacts, such as cave paintings, pottery, and other archaeological finds. These remnants provide a glimpse into the lives of our ancient ancestors and help us understand the evolution of human civilization.

The study of prehistory is a vast and complex field that encompasses the time period before written records exist. Prehistorians rely on archaeological evidence, such as artifacts, architecture, and other material remains, to reconstruct the lives of past societies. This field is divided into several sub-periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each characterized by distinct technological and cultural developments. For instance, the Paleolithic period saw the emergence of early human societies, such as Homo sapiens, who developed tools and languages. The Mesolithic period witnessed the development of more complex societies, marked by the appearance of settled agriculture and the domestication of animals. The Neolithic period saw the rise of large-scale societies, with the development of writing, cities, and complex social hierarchies (Trigger, 2006). Overall, the study of prehistory provides a unique window into the evolution of human societies and the development of modern cultures.

The prehistoric era spanned a vast period of time from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of written records. This era can be divided into distinct periods including the Paleolithic Age, the Mesolithic Age, and the Neolithic Age. During the Paleolithic Age, early humans developed tools and hunting techniques to survive in a harsh environment. As humans migrated and settled in new areas, they began to domesticate plants and animals, marking the start of the Neolithic Age. The Neolithic Age saw significant advancements in agriculture and the development of more complex societies. The Mesolithic Age, also known as the Middle Stone Age, saw the development of more sophisticated tools and the expansion of human settlements. The end of the prehistoric era is often marked by the emergence of written records, typically around 3000 BCE in the ancient civilizations of Mesopotamia and Egypt.
