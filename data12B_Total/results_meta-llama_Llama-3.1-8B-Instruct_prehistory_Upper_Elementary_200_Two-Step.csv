**Summary rewritten for Upper Elementary level (200 words)**

Imagine a time before there were books or written records. This time is called prehistory. It started around 300,000 years ago when the first humans, Homo sapiens, appeared. It lasted until people began writing, which was about 5,000 years ago. During prehistory, people developed complex societies and learned to control fire. They also domesticated animals, created tools, and made art. They used stones and bones to make tools and built early homes. 

Prehistory is divided into three main periods: the Old Stone Age, the Middle Stone Age, and the New Stone Age. Each period saw new discoveries and advancements in tools, homes, and social organization. Even though there were no written records, scientists have pieced together a picture of what life was like during prehistory by digging up artifacts and studying them. This helps us understand how humans evolved",10.7,46.67,12.6,13.1,10.45,13.28,4.66,11.666666666666666

Prehistory is a time before people wrote things down. It was a time of big changes in culture and technology. People were learning new ways to make tools and live together in groups. This time is divided into three periods: the Old Stone Age, the Middle Stone Age, and the New Stone Age. During these periods, people made better tools, like bows and arrows, and started to take care of plants and animals. They moved around a lot and hunted for food, but as they started to grow their own food, they settled in one place and built more complex societies. When people started writing, it marked the end of prehistory and the beginning of history. Archaeologists study prehistory by digging up old things like tools, pottery, and other remains.
