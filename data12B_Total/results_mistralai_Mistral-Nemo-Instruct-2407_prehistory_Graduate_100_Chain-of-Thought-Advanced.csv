The term 'prehistory' refers to the vast period of time before written records were created by humans. This era spanned from the emergence of the first humans around 2.6 million years ago until the development of writing systems, which occurred independently in various civilizations around the world, starting roughly 3,400 years ago. During this extensive span, humans evolved, migrated across the globe, and developed tools, languages, and cultures. Prehistoric societies left behind artifacts, art, and architectural remains that archaeologists study to understand their lives and the course of human history.

Step 5: Check the output against the desired Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level. If the output is too difficult, simplify sentences and reduce the number of complex words. If the output is too easy, add more complex words and sentences. Repeat this process until the desired Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is achieved.

**Final Output:**

Prehistory is the time before written records. It starts with the first humans, around 2.6 million years ago, until the invention of writing, about 5,000 years ago. This period spans from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age. It's called prehistory because we rely on archaeology and paleontology, not written history. These sciences help us understand how early humans lived, migrated, and adapted to their environments.",7.4,60.72,9.3,9.8,7.73,10.77,3.84,5.0

*Step 2:* Prehistory, the time before written records, is when our human ancestors and early humans lived.

*Step 3:* Total words = 16, total sentences = 1, total syllables = 35.

*Step 4:* Prehistory, the time before written records, is when our human ancestors and early humans lived.

*Step 5:* FKGL = 0.39 × (16 / 1) + 11.8 × (35 / 16) - 15.59 ≈ 16.7
