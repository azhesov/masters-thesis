Write a summary about 'nutrition'. Limit the output to 150 words. Nutrition is the intake of food and drinks to maintain health and growth. It includes the process of ingestion, digestion, absorption, and excretion of nutrients. Balanced nutrition ensures the body gets adequate amounts of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals). Poor nutrition can lead to deficiencies, obesity, and chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. Proper nutrition is crucial for all stages of life, from infancy to old age, and influences physical growth, mental development, and overall well-being. Regular exercise and a healthy diet are key components of good nutrition.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 150 words:
