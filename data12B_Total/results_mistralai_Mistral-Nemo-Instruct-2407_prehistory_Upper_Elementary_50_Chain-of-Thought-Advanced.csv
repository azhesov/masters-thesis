The task is to explain 'prehistory' in 50 words, targeting a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 5. To do this, we'll use appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, and ensure the output matches the target grade level.

Let's start with step 1: How would you explain 'prehistory' in 50 words?
```python
""Prehistory is the time before written history. It includes the Stone Age, when humans used tools made of stone.""
```
Now, let's calculate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for this sentence. We'll use the provided formula and the 'pyphen' library to count syllables.
```python
import pyphen
d = pyphen.Pyphen(lang='en')
