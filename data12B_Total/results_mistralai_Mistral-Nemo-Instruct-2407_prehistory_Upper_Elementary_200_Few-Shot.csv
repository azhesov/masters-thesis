As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

In prehistory, people lived in caves and used stone tools. They did not have buildings or cities. They did not have writing or books. They learned by watching and doing, not reading. They followed herds of animals and picked fruits and nuts from trees. Some people lived near the sea and caught fish. In winter, they had to find warm places to live. They did not have clothes that keep them warm all the time. They made clothes from animal skins and covered themselves with blankets made from animal fur.",5.4,82.24,7.5,9.0,7.93,7.88,3.99,7.142857142857142

Prehistory is the time before people began to write things down. It's a period of human history before there was any written evidence of human activities. During prehistory, people hunted animals for food and gathered plants. They lived in caves or built shelters from natural materials like leaves and mud. They used tools made of stone or bone. People in prehistory didn't know how to write, so we know about them from the things they left behind, like paintings on cave walls or bones with marks on them.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 200 words. Prehistory is the time before written history, before the invention of writing, and before we have records written by people themselves. We know about prehistory through archaeology, the study of human-made objects and structures that have been left behind. Archaeologists study these objects and structures to learn about the lives of people who lived during prehistory.

In the time before written history, called prehistory, people didn't write books or keep records. Instead, they left behind things they made, like tools and houses. These things are now studied by archaeologists, who try to learn about the lives of people from that time. Even though there are no written stories, we can still find out a lot about how people lived and what they did. By looking at the things they made and the places they lived, we can understand a little bit about the people from prehistory. It's like trying to figure out a puzzle without all the pieces, but archaeologists are really good at finding clues and putting them",7.5,71.34,9.3,9.9,8.72,8.93,4.24,7.142857142857142

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 200 words. In prehistory, people didn't write things down. So, we can't read about what they thought or did. But, we can learn about them by finding their tools, bones, and art. Archaeologists look for these clues. They dig up old places, like caves or campsites. In these places, they find things like stone axes, animal bones, and paintings on walls. These clues help us know how people lived long ago. For example, if we find a stone ax, we know they used tools to cut things. If we find a painting of an animal, we know they hunted. These clues are like pieces of a puzzle. Each one helps us understand a little more about prehistory.",5.3,82.34,7.3,9.1,7.78,7.59,3.88,7.142857142857142

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 200 words. Prehistory is the span of time before written records were kept, which makes it difficult to study directly. However, archaeologists and paleontologists gather clues from fossils, artifacts, and structures left behind. By studying these clues, they can piece together stories of life on Earth long before humans existed.",7.2,72.05,8.9,10.1,9.31,8.87,4.38,7.142857142857142

As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.

Prehistory was a time before people wrote things down. Imagine a time when humans were hunters and gatherers, living in caves or simple homes. They didn't have books or computers. Instead, they told stories and shared knowledge through pictures painted on cave walls or passed down through generations. These early humans didn't know how to read or write, so we call this time 'prehistory'. It's like trying to understand a story without any words, only pictures. Archaeologists study these pictures and the tools and art these early humans made to learn about their lives. They help us understand how people lived long before history was written down.",6.9,72.76,8.5,9.5,8.42,8.81,4.11,7.142857142857142

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 200 words. Before humans, there were other beings on Earth. They were different from us, but they lived, moved, and breathed just like we do. These beings were the first to walk on Earth. They left behind clues about their lives. Archaeologists have found these clues, like tools made from stone and bones. These clues tell us about prehistory. It's the time before written history, when people didn't write down their stories. Instead, they told them around fires at night. Today, we can only imagine what those stories were like.",6.5,73.88,7.7,9.0,7.9,8.11,3.91,7.142857142857142

Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down. It's like trying to figure out a story without words, just pictures and things people made. We can't ask people from prehistory what they did, but we can look at their tools and art. These clues help us learn about their lives. For example, we can see how they hunted by the spears they left behind. Or we can guess what they liked to draw by looking at the paintings on cave walls.
