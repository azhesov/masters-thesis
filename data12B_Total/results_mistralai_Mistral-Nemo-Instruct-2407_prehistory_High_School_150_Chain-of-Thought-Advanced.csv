Prehistory, the time before written history, spans from the beginning of the universe until the invention of writing. It's divided into eras based on major changes in Earth's history and human development. For instance, the Paleolithic Era, or Stone Age, began around 3 million years ago, when our early human ancestors first used stone tools. This era ended around 12,000 years ago, marking the start of the Neolithic Era, when humans began farming and forming permanent settlements. The Bronze Age followed, characterized by the use of metal tools and weapons. Prehistory ended with the advent of writing, around 3200 BCE in Mesopotamia, allowing for a more accurate record of human history.

The period before written history is called prehistory. This is when humans didn't keep written records. Instead, they used art, tools, and architecture to show their way of life. Archaeologists study these to learn about the past. Prehistory started about 3.3 million years ago with the first stone tools. It ended around 3,000 years ago when written history began.

""Prehistory is the time before written records. It's the period when humans first appeared on Earth. This was a long time ago, before any history books were written. People in prehistory didn't leave written words. Instead, they created art, tools, and buildings. Archaeologists study these to learn about how people lived.
