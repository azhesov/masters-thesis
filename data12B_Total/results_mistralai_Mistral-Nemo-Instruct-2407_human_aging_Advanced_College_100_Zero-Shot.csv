Limit the output to 100 words.,,"Generate a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting readability level Advanced College. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by progressive decline in physiological functions, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and ultimately, death. This process is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetic predispositions and cellular damage accumulation, and extrinsic factors like environmental exposures and lifestyle choices. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of aging, including telomere shortening, epigenetic modifications, and mitochondrial dysfunction, is crucial for developing interventions to extend healthy lifespan. However, it's essential to note that aging is not a uniform process, and individuals vary significantly in their rates of aging and susceptibility to age-related diseases. Therefore, personalized approaches to healthy aging are necessary to maximize the benefits of anti-aging interventions.",17.6,1.84,19.4,17.1,19.44,20.48,7.56,13.5

Human aging, a complex biological process, is characterized by a progressive decline in physiological function, increased vulnerability to disease, and a higher likelihood of death. It results from the interplay of intrinsic factors, such as telomere shortening and epigenetic changes, and extrinsic factors like environmental stressors and lifestyle choices. Theories explaining aging include the wear-and-tear theory, which suggests that aging is due to the accumulation of damage over time, and the programmed theory, which posits that aging is an inevitable part of life due to evolutionary pressures.

Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process involving molecular, cellular, and systemic changes that collectively lead to functional decline and increased vulnerability to disease. Key theories propose that aging results from the accumulation of cellular damage over time, due to factors such as oxidative stress and telomere attrition. Moreover, the immune system weakens, allowing for the proliferation of senescent cells that secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines, further exacerbating age-related pathologies. Interventions targeting these processes, like senolytics and caloric restriction, show promise in extending healthspan, though more research is needed to fully understand and mitigate the effects of human aging.",14.3,26.61,18.3,15.2,16.03,18.85,7.5,12.5

Human aging, a complex biological process, involves progressive, multifactorial changes at molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. It's characterized by a decline in physiological function, increased vulnerability to diseases, and a heightened risk of death. Key hallmarks include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. These processes are influenced by both intrinsic (genetic, epigenetic) and extrinsic (environmental, lifestyle) factors, with a significant interplay between them.
