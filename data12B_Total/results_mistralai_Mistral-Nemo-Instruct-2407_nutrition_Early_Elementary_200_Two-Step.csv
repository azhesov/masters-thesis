Write a summary about 'nutrition'. Limit the output to 200 words. 'Nutrition' encompasses the intake and utilization of food by living organisms. It's crucial for growth, maintenance, reproduction, and health. A balanced diet, consisting of carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, ensures the body functions optimally. Carbohydrates are the primary energy source, while proteins build and repair tissues. Fats provide insulation and absorb fat-soluble vitamins. Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients essential for various bodily functions. Water, the body's primary component, aids in digestion, nutrient absorption, and waste elimination. Malnutrition, whether due to under- or over-nutrition, can lead to severe health issues.
