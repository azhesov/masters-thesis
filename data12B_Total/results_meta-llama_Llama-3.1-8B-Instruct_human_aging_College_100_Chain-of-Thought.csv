Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. The paragraph should explain the concept of human aging.
Human aging is the gradual decline of physical, cognitive, and biological functions in individuals over time. It is a multifaceted process that affects nearly every aspect of human life, from the body's ability to repair itself to the mind's capacity for learning and memory. As we age, our cells undergo changes that can lead to wrinkles, gray hair, and age-related diseases. Our brains also undergo changes that can affect our mood, motivation, and ability to adapt to new situations. Aging is a natural part of life, but it can be influenced by lifestyle, genetics, and environmental factors.

Step 4: Read your paragraph to ensure it is clear and concise.

Here is a paragraph about human aging that could be written for a College-level audience:
Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process influenced by genetic and environmental factors. As we age, our cells undergo a series of changes that impact their function and structure. Telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular senescence. Additionally, epigenetic modifications and oxidative stress can alter gene expression, contributing to age-related diseases. Lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise, and smoking, also play a significant role in determining an individual's aging trajectory. Understanding the underlying mechanisms of human aging is crucial for developing effective interventions to promote healthy aging and mitigate age-related diseases.

Note: I've used a formal tone and complex vocabulary (e.g., ""multifaceted,"" ""epigenetic modifications,"" ""telomeres"") to make the paragraph suitable for a College-level audience.

Step 4: Edit your paragraph to make sure it is clear and concise.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'human aging' to someone reading at the College level.
To explain human aging at the College level, I need to consider the complexities of the biological process and its multifaceted nature. I should focus on key concepts such as cellular senescence, epigenetic changes, and the role of telomere shortening, all of which are supported by empirical research.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
Using clear and concise vocabulary is crucial for an academic audience. I should avoid jargon and technical terms unless they are essential to the explanation. A simple sentence structure will help to convey the information effectively, with a clear introduction, body, and conclusion.

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. 
Human aging is the process of deteriorating physical, mental, and social functions that result from the cumulative effects of time and cellular wear and tear. As we age, our cells undergo changes that can lead to decreased efficiency and increased likelihood of disease. Telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, contributing to cellular aging. Additionally, the accumulation of oxidative stress and epigenetic changes can further accelerate the aging process. These changes can impact physical and cognitive functions, leading to the characteristic signs of aging, such as wrinkles, graying hair, and cognitive decline. 
Step 4: Review the paragraph to ensure it meets the 100-word limit.
Step 5: Revise the paragraph to fit within the 100-word limit while maintaining clarity and coherence.

Step 4: Read the paragraph and revise as needed.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'human aging' to someone reading at the College level.
To explain human aging to someone reading at the College level, I need to consider the audience's prior knowledge and level of complexity they can handle. This means using terms related to biology, genetics, and medical science, while still keeping the explanation clear and concise.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
I will use vocabulary related to cellular and molecular biology, such as 'telomere shortening', 'epigenetic changes', and 'hormonal imbalances'. I will also use sentence structures that are complex enough to convey the intricacies of aging, but not so complex that they become confusing.

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. 

Human aging can be described as a multifaceted process involving both biological and psychological changes that occur over time. From a biological perspective, human aging is characterized by a decline in physiological functions such as metabolism, immune response, and reproductive capacity. This decline is influenced by genetic factors, lifestyle choices, and environmental exposures. Psychologically, human aging is associated with changes in cognitive abilities, emotional regulation, and social relationships. These changes can impact an individual's quality of life, independence, and overall well-being.

Human aging refers to the gradual decline in physical and mental abilities that occurs as an individual gets older. This process is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, shorten as we age, leading to cellular aging. In addition, age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and osteoporosis become more common. Lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise, can impact aging, but ultimately, human aging is a natural and irreversible process that affects all living beings.

Human aging is a multifaceted process involving cellular, molecular, and physiological changes that occur over time. As we age, our cells undergo telomere shortening, leading to reduced cellular division and increased risk of genetic mutations. Simultaneously, our molecular machinery becomes less efficient, resulting in decreased protein synthesis and increased oxidative stress. Physiologically, our body's homeostatic mechanisms become less effective, leading to changes in metabolism, hormone regulation, and immune function. These cumulative changes ultimately contribute to the decline in physical and cognitive abilities characteristic of aging.

Step 4: Revise your paragraph to address the prompt's requirements for a 5-paragraph essay.
