Prehistory refers to the period of time before written records existed. It began at the emergence of the first humans and ended with the invention of writing, around 5,500 years ago. During this time, people developed complex societies, tools, and technologies. Archaeologists use artifacts and other evidence to study prehistory. They find clues in the earth, such as old buildings, tools, and other objects, to understand how people lived, worked, and interacted with each other. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the evolution of human societies and the development of modern cultures.

The earliest humans, who lived before written records, are known as prehistoric people. Prehistory began about 2.5 million years ago and ended about 4,000 years ago, when writing was first developed. During prehistory, people developed from hunter-gatherers to farmers, built homes and communities, and created early tools and art. They also had complex social systems and often built monuments like pyramids and temples. Prehistory ended with the rise of civilization, which brought writing and more complex societies. The study of prehistory helps us understand how people lived, worked, and interacted before the written word.

Here's a sample paragraph explaining prehistory in 100 words and targeting an 8th-grade reading level:
Prehistory is the time before written records. This time period includes everything from the earliest humans to the development of writing. Prehistory can be divided into three parts: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. During the Stone Age, people used tools made of stone and hunted animals for food. The Bronze Age brought metalworking and more advanced tools. The Iron Age saw the development of iron tools and the rise of complex societies. Prehistory is a time of great change and discovery, and it lays the groundwork for modern civilization.

The ancient past is called prehistory because we don't have any written records of what people did during that time. That means that we have to find clues in other ways, like by digging up old things like tools, buildings, and other artifacts that people made. We can also look at pictures and drawings that people made a long time ago. By putting all of these clues together, we can try to figure out what life was like before written history.

Prehistory is the period of time before written records. This means that it was before humans developed the ability to write. People who lived during this time left behind clues, such as tools, art, and buildings, which scientists can study to learn about their lives. By examining these clues, scientists can piece together a picture of what life was like in the past. This helps us understand how humans evolved and developed over time. The study of prehistory is called archaeology. Archaeologists look for clues in the ground, in museums, and in other places where people used to live. They use these clues to tell the story of human history before written records were kept. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the people who came before us and how they lived. We can also learn about the cultures and traditions that shaped human history.

The prehistoric era refers to the period of human history before written records existed. It spans from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of writing, which typically occurred around 5,000 years ago. During this time, early humans developed tools, languages, and social structures. The prehistoric era is often divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. These periods are characterized by significant developments in technology, hunting practices, and agriculture. The prehistoric era laid the foundation for modern human societies.

Here is the final answer.

The time before written history, called prehistory, is a period when humans first appeared and developed tools and societies. Archaeologists study this time by finding and analyzing artifacts, such as fossils, tools, and buildings. They can also learn about past cultures by studying the language and customs of people who came before. By looking at these clues, archaeologists can reconstruct a picture of how people lived, worked, and interacted during prehistory. This helps us understand our own history and how it has shaped the world today.

Prehistory is the time before written records. Before people could write, they left behind clues about their lives. Archaeologists, who are scientists who study old things, find these clues and try to understand what life was like back then. They look at tools, homes, and other things that people left behind. By studying these clues, archaeologists can tell us about the past, but they can't tell us everything. The past is a mystery that we can only guess at. But by studying the clues, we can learn a lot about how people lived and what they did. We can even learn about how they thought and felt. That's what makes prehistory so interesting.
