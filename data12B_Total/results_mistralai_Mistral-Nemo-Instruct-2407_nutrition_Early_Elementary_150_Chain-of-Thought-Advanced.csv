**Paragraph:**

Nutrition is like fuel for our body. It helps us grow, stay healthy, and have energy. We need different types of food to get all the nutrients we need. These nutrients are like tiny helpers that keep our body working right. They give us strength, help us fight off sickness, and make our brain work better. Eating a mix of fruits, vegetables, grains, and proteins gives us the best nutrition. Drinking water is also very important to keep our body hydrated. So, eating right is crucial for a strong and healthy life.
