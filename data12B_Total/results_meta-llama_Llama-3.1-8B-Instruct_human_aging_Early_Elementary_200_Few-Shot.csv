Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

As we grow, we get older. This is called aging. Our bodies change as we age. Our hair gets grayer and longer. Our faces get older and wrinkled. Our bones get weaker. Our skin gets thinner. Some people lose their hair. Some people get cataracts. Some people lose their hearing. Some people get tired easily. These are all signs of aging. But even though we get older, we can still be happy and healthy. We can still walk and run. We can still play and have fun. We can still help others. Aging is a natural part of life. We all get older, but we can still do lots of things. We can still be kind to our friends and family. We can still love and be loved. Aging doesn’t mean we can’t do anything. We can still be happy and make others happy too. We just have to take care of our bodies and stay healthy. This way, we can enjoy life and keep aging",1.5,97.8,1.3,5.8,3.85,2.15,2.4,2.1875

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words. Here is an example of how to structure a paragraph:

1. Start with a basic statement
2. Add some details with 'the' and descriptive words
3. Introduce an unknown and ask a question
4. Add a simple explanation

Our bodies grow and change when we are young. They get stronger and taller. The muscles in our arms and legs get stronger. The heart beats faster. The skin gets softer. But as time passes, our bodies start to change again. They get older. The skin gets wrinkly. The muscles get weaker. The heart beats slower. Our bodies start to lose some of their strength. Then we start to lose some of our hair. It’s hard to know how long we will live. Do you know what makes our bodies age? Our bodies are made up of tiny tiny things called cells. These cells are like little building blocks. When the cells get old, they start to break down. Then our bodies start to age. Our cells are",1.5,97.7,1.7,5.9,3.97,2.86,2.47,2.1875

As we grow up, our bodies change. We get older. Our hair gets gray. Our skin gets wrinkles. But our brain is always smart. It helps us learn and remember things. We can read books, watch TV, and play with friends. When we are old, we might have gray hair and wrinkles. But we are still the same person. We are still smart and happy. We can play with our grandkids. We can tell them stories. We can show them things we learned when we were little. Our bodies get older, but our heart stays young. We can still love and be loved. We can still be happy. We can still play and have fun. Aging is a natural part of life. We all get older. But we can still be happy and smart. We can still be the best version of ourselves.

As we grow up, we get older. This is called aging. People get older every year. Our bodies change when we get older. Sometimes they change a little bit, and sometimes they change a lot. When we are little, we are very fast. We can run and jump very high. But when we get older, we can’t run and jump as fast. That is because our muscles get weaker. When we are little, our bodies are like a strong, new bike. But when we get older, our bodies are like a bike that has been used for a long time. They still work, but they don’t work as well as they used to. We can still do lots of things, but we might need to rest more often. Some people get gray hair when they get older.

Human aging is a process. Human bodies change as we grow old. At first, our bodies are very strong. Then, over time, our bodies get weaker. Our muscles get smaller, and we can’t run as fast as we used to. Our bones get thinner, and we might get hurt more easily. Our hair turns gray and falls out. Our skin gets wrinkles, and we might feel cold more often. But our brains stay sharp. We can still remember things we learned a long time ago. We can still solve problems and make new friends. Some people have gray hair and still run marathons. They are an inspiration to everyone. Aging is a normal process. It is a part of life. We all get older. But we can still do many things and enjoy life. We can read books, watch movies, and spend time with our loved ones.

As people grow older, they change. They grow taller, but then they stop. They also get heavier. People get gray hair when they are old. That is because the color of their hair is not being made. Their eyes get weaker. That means they cannot see as well. They walk slower. People have more wrinkles on their face. That is because their skin gets older. They also get tired more easily. Then they rest more. Some people walk with a cane or a walker. That is because they need help standing or walking. Even though people change, they still love and are loved. They still live in a house. They still eat food. People are still happy and sad. As people get older, they know more. They learn about their life and the world. They also share their knowledge with others. People get older, but they are still special.

As we grow up, our bodies change. People age. When we are young, our skin is smooth. But as we grow older, our skin gets wrinkles. It gets hard to walk fast. Our muscles get weaker. We feel tired more easily. Our eyesight gets less good. We need glasses. Our hearing gets less good too. We need to wear earplugs to hear well. Our teeth get crooked and fall out. We need to brush our teeth more often. Some people lose their hair. It’s okay! It’s all part of aging. We all get old. But we can stay healthy. We need to eat well. We need to exercise. We need to rest. We need to take care of ourselves. Our bodies will be strong and healthy. We will be happy and feel good. As we grow old, our hearts will be full of love and kindness.

As we grow up, our bodies change. We get taller, our voices change, and our skin gets wrinkles. This is called aging. It happens to everyone. Sometimes our eyesight gets worse. Sometimes we get tired more easily. It’s like our body is a house and our age is the years we live in that house. Just like how a house can get old and worn out, our bodies can too. But just like how a house can be fixed, our bodies can be healthy too! We can eat well, sleep well, and play outside. This will help our body stay strong and healthy. Some people may look older than others because of how they take care of their bodies. It’s not fair to compare, though. Everyone ages at a different rate. It’s like how houses get old at different rates depending on how well they are taken care of. We all age, but we can all be healthy and happy!

As humans get older, their bodies change. Their skin gets older. It gets wrinkles. It gets lines. People say, ""You look older."" But that is good. It means they are wise. Our bodies get weaker. We can’t run as fast as we used to. But our minds get stronger. We can learn new things. We can do new things. We can help our friends and family. Our hair gets gray. It gets thin. We get tired. But we can rest. We can take care of ourselves. We can be happy. When we get older, we can teach our children. We can tell them stories. We can show them the world. We can share our wisdom. So, as humans get older, it is a good thing. It means we are growing up. It means we are becoming wise. It means we are becoming the people we are meant to be.
