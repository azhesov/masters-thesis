Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 150 words. Prehistory refers to the time before written records began, extending from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. It's divided into three main periods: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Stone Age is further divided into Paleolithic (Old Stone), Mesolithic (Middle Stone), and Neolithic (New Stone) eras. These periods are characterized by the type of tools and technology used, with stone tools being dominant. The Bronze Age marked a significant shift with the discovery of metalworking, while the Iron Age saw widespread use of iron tools. Prehistory is crucial for understanding human evolution, migration, and the development of early cultures and civilizations. Archaeological findings, such as artifacts, fossils, and architectural remains, provide insights into these periods, as written records were not yet available.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Middle School and limit the output to 150 words:
