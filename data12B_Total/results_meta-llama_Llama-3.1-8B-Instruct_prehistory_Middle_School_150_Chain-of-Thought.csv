Prehistory refers to the period before written records existed. It began millions of years ago, when the first humans appeared on Earth. During this time, humans lived in small groups and developed tools to survive. The earliest tools were made from stone, wood, and bone.

Prehistory refers to the period before written records existed. It began millions of years ago, when the first humans appeared on Earth. During this time, humans lived in small groups, often in caves or near rivers. These early humans developed tools to survive, using stone, wood, and bone to hunt, gather, and protect themselves.

Prehistory is the time period before written records existed. This means there are no written documents from that time to tell us what life was like. Because of this, historians must use other clues to figure out what happened. These clues include objects, pictures, and remains of buildings that have been discovered. Historians study these clues to make educated guesses about the past. They also use archaeology, which is the study of artifacts and the sites where they were found. By combining these clues, historians can build a picture of life in prehistoric times. For example, if a historian finds a fossilized skeleton of a large animal and nearby tools made by early humans, it is possible to infer that early humans hunted these animals for food. By studying the past, historians can learn more about how our world came to be and how it has changed over time.

The prehistoric period is a time before written records existed. It is the time before the ancient civilizations of Egypt, Greece, and Rome. We know about prehistory through archaeology, which is the study of old objects and the places where they were found. Archaeologists look for clues like tools, houses, and other artifacts that can tell us about how people lived. They can also look at the remains of animals and plants to learn about the environment of the past. By studying these clues, we can learn about the daily lives of people who lived long ago, their culture, and their way of life. This helps us understand how humans developed and changed over time.

Prehistory refers to the time period before written records existed. During this time, humans were still evolving and learning how to adapt to their environments. The earliest humans, known as Paleolithic people, lived about 2.5 million years ago and were nomadic hunter-gatherers. They traveled from place to place in search of food and shelter. As time passed, humans developed tools made from stone, bone, and wood. These early tools helped people to hunt and gather more efficiently. The development of agriculture, which occurred around 10,000 years ago, marked a significant turning point in human history. With a stable food source, people were able to settle in one place and build more complex societies. This led to the rise of cities and the development of governments, laws, and social hierarchies. The study of prehistory helps us understand how humans evolved and developed over time. It also provides valuable insights into the lives of our ancestors.

The time before recorded history is called prehistory. Prehistory starts at the beginning of human life on Earth and continues until writing was invented. People who lived before writing existed didn't leave us any written records of their lives, so we can't know everything about them. We have to use other clues to figure out how people lived. We can learn about the past by looking at the tools they made, the food they ate, and the places where they lived. We can also learn by studying the bones and other remains of people and animals. Archaeologists are people who study prehistory. They search for clues and try to understand how people lived a long time ago. By studying prehistory, we can learn more about how humans evolved and developed over time.

**Prehistory** is a period of time that happened before written records existed. This time period spans from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing, around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. During prehistory, people lived in small groups, often in caves or other temporary shelters. They hunted and gathered food, and eventually developed agriculture. As populations grew, people began to settle in one place and build more permanent homes. Over time, they created tools, such as stone knives and bows, which helped them survive and thrive in their environments. Prehistory is a fascinating era that helps us understand how humans adapted to their surroundings and developed the skills necessary for modern society.

These clues help us understand what life was like in the past. We can also look at the earth and see how it has changed over time.

Prehistory refers to the time before written records existed. This period stretches from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing systems. During this time, people lived in small groups and relied on hunting, gathering, and farming to survive. They developed tools, like stone knives and arrowheads, to help them make a living. As populations grew, so did the complexity of societies. Early humans built shelters, hunted in organized groups, and began to trade goods. This gradual development of cultures and civilizations laid the groundwork for the emergence of complex societies. While we don't have written records from this period, archaeologists have pieced together a picture of prehistoric life through the study of artifacts, fossils, and other evidence.

Imagine a time before recorded history. Before we had clocks, calendars, and newspapers, our ancestors lived and thrived. This is called prehistory. It lasted from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. During this time, people hunted and gathered food, built shelters, and developed tools made from stone, wood, and bone. As time passed, people began to settle in one place and create more complex societies. They developed skills like farming and pottery. They also created art and jewelry to express themselves. We can learn about prehistory by studying the artifacts that remain, like fossils, pottery, and tools. These clues help us understand how our ancestors lived and how they changed over time. By studying prehistory, we can gain a deeper appreciation for our own history and the people who came before us.

The term ""prehistory"" refers to the time period before humans started writing down their stories and histories. During this time, humans lived in small groups and developed ways of surviving and thriving in their environments. They made tools from stone, bone, and wood, and hunted animals for food. The earliest prehistoric humans, such as Homo sapiens, roamed the Earth around 300,000 years ago. One of the most well-known prehistoric cultures is the Neanderthals, who lived in Europe and Asia around 400,000 years ago. They were skilled hunters and gathered berries and other plants for food. The Neanderthals are famous for their ability to adapt to cold climates and make tools from bones and stones. Their legacy can still be seen in the fossils and artifacts that remain today, giving us a glimpse into the lives of people who lived thousands of years ago.
