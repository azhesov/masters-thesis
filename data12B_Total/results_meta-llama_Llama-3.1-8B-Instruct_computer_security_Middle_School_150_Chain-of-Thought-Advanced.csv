Computer security is the protection of information technology from theft, damage, or unauthorized access. It involves many things, including passwords, firewalls, and antivirus software. A strong password is hard to guess and contains numbers, letters, and special characters. Firewalls are like shields that keep hackers out of a computer or network. Antivirus software scans for and removes viruses, which can damage a computer or steal information. When a computer is connected to the internet, it can be vulnerable to cyber attacks. That's why it's so important to keep your computer and software up to date. This helps to fix security holes and protect your computer from harm. 

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'computer security' in 150 words.
To explain 'computer security' in 150 words, we need to break it down into simple terms. We should focus on what it means, why it's important, and some basic ways to protect a computer from security threats.
