What are the five major types of astronomical objects? 1. Stars: massive balls of hot, glowing gas, which are the primary source of light and heat in the universe. 2. Galaxies: massive collections of stars, gas, and dust, which are held together by gravity. 3. Nebulae: vast, interstellar clouds of gas and dust, which are the raw material for star formation. 4. Black Holes: regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that not even light can escape. 5. Comets: icy bodies that originate from the outer reaches of the solar system and can produce spectacular tails of gas and dust when they approach the Sun.
