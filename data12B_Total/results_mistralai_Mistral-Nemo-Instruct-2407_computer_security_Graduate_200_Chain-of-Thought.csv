Computer security, a critical aspect of modern digital landscapes, refers to the protection of computer systems, networks, and sensitive information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This multifaceted field encompasses various aspects, including but not limited to, encryption, authentication, access control, intrusion detection, and secure system design. It is predicated on the principles of confidentiality, integrity, and availability, often abbreviated as CIA triad. Confidentiality ensures that data is accessed only by authorized entities, integrity maintains the accuracy and consistency of data over its entire lifecycle, and availability guarantees timely and reliable access to and use of information. Computer security also extends to protecting against malicious software (malware), such as viruses, worms, and ransomware, which can compromise systems and data. Moreover, it involves responding to security breaches and incidents, and mitigating their impacts through incident response plans",15.3,18.65,17.5,16.6,17.75,17.75,7.2,13.166666666666666
