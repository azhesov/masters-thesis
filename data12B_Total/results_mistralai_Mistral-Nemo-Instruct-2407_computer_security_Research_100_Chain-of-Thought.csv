Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. The paragraph should be able to stand alone.
Step 4: Read the paragraph to someone who is not familiar with computer security. Ask them if they understand the topic and whether the text seems to be at the right level.

Here's the plan:

1. **Explain 'computer security' as a field of study focused on protecting digital systems and data from threats and misuse.**
2. **Use technical terms like 'cyber attacks', 'vulnerabilities', 'encryption', and 'authentication'.**
3. **Compare it to physical security, making it relatable.**
4. **Highlight its importance in our increasingly digital world.**

Now, here's the paragraph following the plan:

""Computer security, also known as cybersecurity, is a broad field dedicated to safeguarding digital systems and data from a myriad of threats. It involves identifying and mitigating vulnerabilities that could be exploited by cyber attacks, similar to how physical security protects buildings and valuables from intruders.
