Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Prehistory is the period of time before written records were created. It's a time when humans didn't leave behind detailed accounts of their lives. Instead, we learn about prehistory through archaeologyâ€”finding and studying artifacts. Prehistoric people had no written language, so their history is pieced together from tools, art, and structures they left behind. This lack of written records makes understanding prehistory challenging, but also fascinating.",13.1,40.58,14.9,14.9,13.66,13.0,5.86,17.75

Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Prehistory refers to the period before written records began. This era lacks historical documentation, so scholars must rely on artifacts, structures, and other physical evidence. Prehistory is often divided into Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age based on the dominant tools and technology.",13.6,39.16,15.2,15.4,14.61,12.94,6.12,17.75
