Prehistory is the period before recorded history. It began around 3 million years ago when the first humans emerged in Africa and lasted until about 5,200 years ago when civilizations in the Middle East developed writing. During this time, early humans formed complex societies with social structures, technologies, and cultures. They hunted and gathered food, and later domesticated plants and animals to survive. As populations grew, societies became more complex, including tribes and early states. The invention of tools, like stone and metal tools, helped humans adapt to their environments and expand their territories. Fire, language, art, and symbolism were also significant discoveries.
