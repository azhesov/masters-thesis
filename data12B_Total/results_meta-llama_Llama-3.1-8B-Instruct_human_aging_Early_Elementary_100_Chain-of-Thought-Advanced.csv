Human aging is when people get old. It is a process. People are born. They live. They get older. This makes their bodies weaker. They might get sick. It is hard to stop aging. People try to make it slower. But it is not easy. Some people are old when they die. This is natural. Aging happens to everyone. It is a part of life.

People grow old. Our bodies change. We get wrinkles. Our hair turns gray. We feel tired. We can't run as fast. We can't jump as high. We have more trouble walking. That is aging. It happens to everyone. We can't stop it. We can't make it go away. We just have to deal with it. We have to take care of our bodies. We have to eat good food. We have to get enough rest. We have to stay healthy. Aging is a part of life. It is normal. We have to accept it. We have to be happy. We have to be strong. We have to keep going.
