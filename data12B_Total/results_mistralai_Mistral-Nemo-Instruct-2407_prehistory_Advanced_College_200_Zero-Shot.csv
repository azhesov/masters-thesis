Prehistory, a term coined in the 19th century, refers to the span of human existence before written records were kept. This era, preceding the advent of civilization, is typically divided into three periods: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. These designations are based on the dominant tools and technologies used by humans during each phase. The Stone Age, further subdivided into Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods, was characterized by the use of stone tools and a hunter-gatherer lifestyle. The Bronze Age saw the introduction of metallurgy, with bronze becoming the primary material for tool and weapon production. The Iron Age marked a significant shift, as iron replaced bronze due to its superior strength and durability. Prehistory is studied through archaeology, anthropology, and other related disciplines, which utilize artifacts, architecture, and environmental evidence to reconstruct the lives of our ancestors and understand the evolution of human culture and society.",12.9,35.68,14.9,15.8,17.02,15.03,6.18,10.142857142857142

Prehistory, an expansive temporal realm preceding written records, is a fascinating epoch that encompasses the dawn of humanity. It is divisible into several periods based on the evolution of Homo sapiens and their cultural developments. The Lower Paleolithic era, spanning from 3.3 million years ago to around 300,000 years ago, witnessed the emergence of the first Homo species, Homo habilis, and the development of early stone tools, known as Oldowan tools. The Middle Paleolithic, from approximately 300,000 to 30,000 years ago, saw the advent of Homo neanderthalensis and the creation of more sophisticated tools, the Mousterian industry. The Upper Paleolithic, from around 40,000 to 10,000 years ago, marks the era of modern humans, Homo sapiens, and the birth of art, symbolism, and complex cultures.

Prehistory, a temporal domain predating recorded history, encompasses the era when humans' primary means of communication were oral traditions, symbols, and artifacts. This epoch spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the advent of written records, circa 3400 BCE in Mesopotamia and 1600 BCE in Egypt. During prehistory, human societies transitioned from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to more sedentary, agricultural communities.
