""Human aging is a natural process that happens over time. It starts when we're born and continues until we die. As we grow older, our bodies change. We might become shorter, our skin may wrinkle, and our hair could turn gray or fall out. Our senses, like seeing and hearing, may not work as well as they used to. Our bodies might not heal as quickly, and we might need more sleep. These changes are normal parts of getting older, and they happen to everyone. Scientists are still learning about why and how these changes occur.""",4.2,85.28,5.9,7.2,6.02,7.06,3.77,5.0

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Human aging is the gradual process of growing older and experiencing changes in our bodies and minds. It's like a journey where, as we get older, our bodies work a little less well. For example, our muscles might get smaller, or our bones might get weaker. Our senses, like hearing and seeing, may not be as sharp as they once were. Our minds might not remember things as easily, either. But it's important to note that everyone ages differently, and it's a normal part of life.",6.3,74.49,7.4,9.2,7.76,8.0,4.23,6.857142857142857

As time passes, our bodies go through many changes. Just like a favorite book, we might not notice these changes immediately, but they add up over the years. This process is called 'human aging'. It begins with our cells, the tiny building blocks of our body. As we grow older, our cells divide and replicate fewer times, leading to a decrease in the number of healthy cells. Additionally, our cells may accumulate damage over time, affecting how well they function. This damage can be caused by various factors, such as oxidative stress, which is like rust on a car, or changes in our DNA, which can lead to mutations. As a result of these changes, our body's systems may not work as efficiently as they used to, contributing to the signs of aging we see, like wrinkles, grey hair, and slowed healing. However, it's important to remember that while aging is a natural part of life, it's also a complex process",7.1,72.46,8.5,9.5,8.63,8.47,4.4,5.0

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. The paragraph should define human aging in a clear, concise manner. You may use any reasonable definition of 'aging' that you think is appropriate for your audience. You should also include information about some of the factors that contribute to aging.
Step 4: Write a second paragraph that describes some of the changes that occur in the body as it ages. You may describe changes in any of the body's systems. Again, you should write in clear, concise language using appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
Step 5: Write a third paragraph that describes how scientists and researchers study aging. You may discuss different types of studies, the goals of the research, and the challenges that researchers face.",7.6,65.73,9.5,9.1,7.68,10.66,4.49,7.2857142857142865
