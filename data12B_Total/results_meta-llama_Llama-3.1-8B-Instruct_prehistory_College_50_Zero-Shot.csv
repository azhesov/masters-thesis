The term ""prehistory"" refers to the period of human history before written records existed. This era spans from the emergence of the first humans around 6 million years ago to the development of writing systems, approximately 5,500 years ago. During prehistory, humans evolved, migrated, and developed complex societies without leaving behind a written legacy. The lack of written records makes prehistory a subject of interpretation and inference. Scholars use archaeological findings, oral traditions, and environmental data to reconstruct the lives of our ancient ancestors. This challenging yet fascinating field of study continues to unravel the mysteries of human evolution and the earliest human societies. The period is typically divided into three main eras: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), the Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and the Neolithic (New Stone Age). These eras are characterized by significant technological and cultural advancements, including the development of tools, agriculture, and complex social structures. The study of prehistory provides valuable insights into the origins of human civilization",13.1,29.65,14.7,14.7,15.02,15.95,5.87,10.285714285714286
