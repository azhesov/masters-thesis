Step 4: Follow your plan and write the final paragraph. It will be short, and it will be clear, because you will choose simple and concise language.
Step 5: Count the number of words, syllables, and sentences in the output, and use the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula to calculate the grade level.
Step 6: Check if the calculated grade level is close to the target of 13, and make adjustments if necessary.
Step 7: If the calculated grade level is still not close to the target, you may need to rephrase the output to better fit the target audience and grade level. You can use the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula to evaluate the output at each iteration.
Step 8: Once you are satisfied with the output, you can finalize it and use it to explain 'computer security' in a way that is clear and easy to understand for a 13-year-old.
