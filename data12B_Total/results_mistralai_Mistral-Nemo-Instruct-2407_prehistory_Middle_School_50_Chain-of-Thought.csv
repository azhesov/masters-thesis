Prehistory is the time before written history. It's like the story of the world before people could write it down. We call it prehistory because there were no books or newspapers to record what happened. Instead, scientists like archaeologists and paleontologists study fossils, bones, and artifacts to learn about this time. They even look at cave paintings and tools people used. It's like putting together a puzzle without any pictures or instructions.",6.9,67.35,9.4,9.9,8.51,11.01,3.91,6.75

Prehistory is the time before written records were kept. It started about 3 million years ago and ended around 5,000 years ago. In this time, people lived as hunters and gatherers, relying on nature for their food and shelter. They did not have cities or books, so we don't have written information about their lives. Archaeologists use tools and artifacts to learn about this period.",7.2,66.64,8.4,9.8,9.43,9.44,4.16,6.5
