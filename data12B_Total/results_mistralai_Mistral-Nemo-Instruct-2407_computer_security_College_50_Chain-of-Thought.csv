Computer security, in essence, is the safeguarding of data and systems from malicious actors. It encompasses both preventive measures, such as firewalls and encryption, and responsive strategies like incident management and recovery plans. Understanding this field requires familiarity with terms like'malware', 'phishing', and 'cyber attack'. Ultimately, it's crucial to stay informed and vigilant to protect against evolving threats. **Therefore, always keep your software up-to-date.**",10.3,42.38,12.9,12.1,12.58,14.72,5.64,7.875

**Paragraph:**

""Computer security, a critical aspect of modern digital life, entails safeguarding data and systems from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption. This involves identifying and mitigating 'vulnerabilities'â€”weaknesses in software, hardware, or user practices that hackers exploit. By implementing robust security measures, such as strong passwords, firewalls, and regular software updates, we can significantly reduce these vulnerabilities, thus protecting our digital assets.""",12.4,31.48,14.6,13.0,13.45,15.65,6.12,7.75
