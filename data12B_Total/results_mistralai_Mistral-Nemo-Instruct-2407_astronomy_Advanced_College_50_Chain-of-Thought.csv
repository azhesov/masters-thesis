Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Make sure to include the phrase 'investigates the celestial bodies'.
Astronomy, at its core, is the scientific discipline that investigates the celestial bodies and phenomena that originate in outer space. It encompasses a broad spectrum of topics, from the study of stars and planets to the exploration of galaxies and black holes. Through a combination of observation, theory, and experimentation, astronomers seek to understand the fundamental laws that govern the universe and its myriad components.",10.7,46.88,12.5,13.5,13.93,13.45,5.63,9.0

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Use formal language and avoid contractions. For example, use 'do not' instead of 'don't'.
Step 4: Check your paragraph to ensure it is formal and follows your plan. Make any necessary changes.

**Step 1:** To explain 'astronomy' at the Advanced College level, one must describe it as the scientific study of celestial objects, spaces, and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. The subject encompasses a wide range of topics, including the properties and behaviors of celestial bodies, the structure and evolution of the universe, and the physical processes that govern the cosmos.

**Step 2:** To maintain a formal tone and advanced level, use descriptive adjectives, precise verbs, and complex sentence structures. Avoid colloquial language and simplistic phrasing.

**Step 3:** ""Astronomy, at its essence, is the systematic, empirical investigation of celestial bodies, phenomena, and spaces beyond Earth's atmosphere. It explores the intrinsic characteristics and dynamics of celestial objects, del",10.0,48.6,12.5,12.5,11.98,13.39,5.03,6.0

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Remember to include 'astronomy'.
Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere, is a multifaceted discipline that encompasses physics, mathematics, and chemistry. It explores the nature, properties, and interactions of celestial bodies such as stars, galaxies, and planets, and seeks to understand their origins and evolution. Through telescopic observations, theoretical models, and spacecraft missions, astronomers unravel the mysteries of the universe, from the microcosm of atomic nuclei to the macrocosm of cosmic structures.",13.2,29.45,15.5,14.3,14.56,16.3,6.45,10.857142857142858
