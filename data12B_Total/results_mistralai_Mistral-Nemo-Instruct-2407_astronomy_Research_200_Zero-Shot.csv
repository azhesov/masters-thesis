'Astronomy' is a branch of science that involves the study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe. It is a fascinating field that has captivated human curiosity for centuries. Astronomy uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry to explain the origin, evolution, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the properties and behavior of celestial bodies. Some of the key areas of research in astronomy include the study of stars, galaxies, black holes, and the properties of dark matter and dark energy. Astronomy also plays a crucial role in our understanding of the Earth's climate and environment, as well as the search for extraterrestrial life. With the advent of advanced technologies such as telescopes, satellites, and space probes, astronomers have been able to make groundbreaking discoveries and expand our knowledge of the universe. However, despite these advancements, there is still much that we do not know about the cosmos, and astronomy continues to be a vibrant and exciting field of research.",12.2,42.92,14.0,14.1,13.54,13.17,6.14,12.0

The paragraph should also contain the term'stellar'.

Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena, has greatly advanced our understanding of the universe. Stellar astronomy, a subfield focusing on stars, has been particularly revealing. By examining the light emitted by stars, astronomers have determined their temperatures, compositions, and ages. This has led to the discovery that our Sun is a relatively young star, with many others billions of years older. Moreover, the study of stellar evolution has shown that stars go through distinct phases, from their birth as nebulae to their eventual deaths as white dwarfs or supernovae. These insights, along with advancements in telescope technology, continue to drive our exploration of the cosmos.",10.2,48.2,13.0,13.0,13.78,14.49,6.11,7.75

The paragraph should explain what astronomy is, its history, and its main branches.

Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere, has its roots in ancient civilizations. Early astronomers, like the ancient Greeks and Chinese, observed and recorded the positions of stars, planets, and constellations, often using their findings to predict events and influence cultures. Today, astronomy is a modern, evidence-based discipline with several main branches. Astrophysics explores the physical properties and interactions of celestial bodies, while astrobiology seeks to understand the origin, evolution, and distribution of life in the universe. Cosmology focuses on the origin and evolution of the entire universe, and solar astronomy studies the Sun and its influence on Earth and other planets. These branches work together to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos, using powerful tools such as telescopes, spacecraft, and advanced computational models.",13.8,28.03,16.0,15.0,14.12,16.41,6.36,10.857142857142858
