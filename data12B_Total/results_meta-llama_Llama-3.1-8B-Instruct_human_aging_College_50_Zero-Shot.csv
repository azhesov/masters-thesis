Limit the output to 50 words.,,"Generate a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting readability level College. Limit the output to 50 words. The human aging process is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involves the gradual deterioration of bodily functions and structures over time. Cellular senescence, oxidative stress, and epigenetic changes are key contributors to this process. Aging is influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. It is characterized by decreased physical and cognitive performance, increased susceptibility to disease, and a heightened risk of mortality. Advanced age is associated with a decline in physiological homeostasis and a reduction in the body's ability to repair and adapt to environmental stressors. The underlying mechanisms of aging remain poorly understood, but research is ongoing to identify potential therapeutic interventions and to promote healthy aging....

Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process influenced by various genetic and environmental factors. Telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, contributing to cellular senescence. This decline is exacerbated by oxidative stress, epigenetic modifications, and lifestyle choices, ultimately leading to the accumulation of cellular damage and age-related diseases. 

(Note: Readability level of this paragraph is approximately 10th grade.) 

Here is a revised version of the paragraph, targeted at a College level (approximately 13th grade) with 50 words:

Human aging is a complex, dynamic process influenced by genetic and environmental factors, including telomere shortening, oxidative stress, and epigenetic modifications. These factors contribute to cellular senescence, leading to the accumulation of damage and age-related diseases. Lifestyle choices also play a significant role in modulating the aging process.
