Astronomy is the science of studying the sky and everything in it. This includes stars, planets, and galaxies. Astronomy helps us understand how the universe works. It also helps us find new places in space where life might be possible. People have studied the sky for thousands of years. They used tools like telescopes to see things far away. Today, scientists use powerful computers and special instruments to learn more about the universe.
