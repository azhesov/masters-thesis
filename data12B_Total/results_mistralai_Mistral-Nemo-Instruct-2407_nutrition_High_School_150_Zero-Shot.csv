Nutrition, derived from the Latin 'nutrire', means 'to nourish' or 'to feed'. It's the process of providing our bodies with the right amount of food to function optimally. This includes eating a balance of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Carbohydrates, our body's primary energy source, are found in fruits, grains, and vegetables. Proteins, crucial for growth and repair, are present in lean meats, poultry, fish, beans, and nuts. Fats, essential for absorbing certain vitamins, are found in avocados, nuts, and fatty fish like salmon. Vitamins and minerals are necessary in small quantities, playing vital roles in our body's processes. Eating a variety of foods ensures we get a wide range of nutrients, promoting overall health and well-being.",8.7,57.37,12.3,12.9,12.47,13.16,5.4,7.75
