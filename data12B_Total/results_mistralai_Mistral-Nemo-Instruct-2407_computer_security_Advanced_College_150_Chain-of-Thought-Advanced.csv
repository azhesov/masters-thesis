Computer security is like protecting your home. You lock your doors, windows, and even hide your valuables. Computers need similar protection. It's about keeping hackers out and your data safe. You use passwords, firewalls, and anti-virus software, just like a lock on your door. Regular updates are like fixing a broken window. They patch holes that hackers can exploit. It's also important to be careful online, like not clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files. This is like inviting a stranger into your home. Lastly, backing up your data is like keeping a spare key. If something happens to your computer, you can still access your information.",7.2,61.22,8.5,9.3,7.79,10.3,4.41,5.3
