In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on.

Prehistory is the period before recorded history. It is the time when early humans were still learning how to survive and live on Earth. During this time, humans did not have writing or any other ways to record their history. They passed on their knowledge and traditions through stories and customs. Their lives were often harsh and unpredictable, and they struggled to find food and shelter. Prehistory lasted for thousands of years. Over time, humans learned new skills and adapted to their environment, which helped them to become more successful and live longer. Eventually, the first civilizations emerged, marking the beginning of recorded history. The study of prehistory helps us understand how our ancestors lived and how their ways of life were different from ours. It also gives us a glimpse of the history that was lost forever.

The artifacts of prehistory are placed in large dry rooms, where they are kept in crates, each one separate and standing upright. The air is controlled, coming from a furnace attached to the engine room below, and is regulated by dampers to add or reduce heat. A blower is attached to keep the air moving, and the air as it cools passes off through a pipe in the roof, while the heated air comes in from below. These rooms are also equipped with a network of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at a consistent level, allowing for a thorough drying process. In a short time, the artifacts, once shrouded in mystery, are dried, preserved, and ready for study, giving us a glimpse into the lives of people who lived long ago. This process helps us to understand the cultures of the past.

Prehistory began millions of years ago, however, the earliest humans are not well-documented. Furthermore, they left behind no written records, and their daily lives were not recorded in any other way. Nonetheless, archaeologists have pieced together a rough timeline of human development, and the evidence points to humans escaping with a whole skin from the harsh climate and dangers of the Ice Age. The early humans likely migrated to warmer climates, where their fate would have fallen to being hunters and gatherers. In addition, they likely regulated their lives by the cycles of nature, using the stars, moon, and sun to guide their daily activities. These",8.0,75.34,10.7,10.2,10.51,8.12,4.94,11.0

Prehistory is a time of the past that is before written records were kept. This means that we cannot know exactly what happened during prehistory, but we can try to figure it out from clues like old tools, pictures, and other things that have been left behind. We can also learn about prehistory from the way people live in similar areas today. Just like how the old woman in the village didn't know what would happen to her bean, the people of prehistory didn't know what would happen to them either. But they had to make the best of their lives, using what they had to survive and thrive. They were clever and resourceful, and their efforts have helped us to learn about their lives and the world they lived in.

In prehistory, people didn’t have writing. But they left behind many things that help us learn about their lives. ‘Fossils, bones, and stones’ can tell us about their food, clothes, and tools. ‘Rock art’ and ‘cave paintings’ show us what they looked like and what they believed in. ‘Tools and weapons’ show us how they made their living. And ‘homes and settlements’ tell us how they lived and organized themselves. We can also learn from the things they left behind, like their ‘trash and waste’. All these things help us piece together the story of how people lived before we had writing. By studying these leftovers, we can imagine what life was like in prehistory. It is like finding a lost piece of a puzzle and understanding how our world came to be.

The term 'prehistory' is a complex subject, so I would like to focus on making it accessible to students with some historical knowledge. 

Prehistory is the time before written records were kept. It is a long period that spans millions of years. During this time, early humans roamed the earth and developed tools. These tools were made from stones, bones, and wood. The early humans used them to hunt and gather food. They also used them to make shelter and protect themselves from harm. As time passed, humans learned to control fire, which was a major breakthrough. Fire allowed them to cook their food, stay warm in the cold, and ward off predators. The discovery of fire marked the beginning of a new era in human history. It was a time of great change and discovery, and it paved the way for the development of more complex societies.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them.

The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Prehistory was the time before written records existed. It was a time of discovery and innovation. People learned to make tools and use fire. They hunted and gathered food. Early humans, like our ancestors, roamed the earth in search of resources. In the process, they encountered many challenges, such as fierce animals and harsh weather conditions. Yet, they adapted and thrived. They also developed social structures and traded goods with one another. Prehistory was marked by the rise of civilizations, each with their own unique culture and traditions. The study of prehistory helps us understand how our world came to be the way it is today. By examining artifacts and evidence, we can piece together a picture of the past, and learn from the successes and failures of our ancestors.

Prehistory is the long time period that existed before written records were kept. It began after the earth cooled enough to support life and ended when humans developed writing, around 5,000 years ago. The prehistoric people lived in different parts of the world, including Africa, Asia, Europe, and the Americas. They hunted wild animals, gathered fruits and berries, and fished in rivers and oceans. Some prehistoric people also farmed the land, growing crops like wheat and corn. Over time, humans developed tools made of stone, wood, and bone, which made life easier and helped them build shelters and communities. These early humans also created beautiful artwork, like cave paintings and carvings, which have been found in many parts of the world. Their lives were very different from ours today, but they paved the way for the civilizations that followed.

Prehistory was a time before recorded history, where people lived without leaving behind any written documents. During this period, humans migrated from one place to another, and their tools and skills improved with time. The people of prehistory used stones, bones, and wood to create tools, and they also made shelters using branches and animal hides. Their homes were simple and temporary, and they moved frequently to find food and water. As the years passed, people began to settle in one place, and their homes became more permanent. The prehistoric era was a time of great change and discovery, and it laid the foundation for the civilizations that followed. It was a time when humans first learned to control fire, make clothes, and grow their own food.
