Prehistory is the time before written history. People used tools made of stone, wood, and bone. They lived in caves or simple houses. They hunted animals and gathered food. They didn't have books, but they told stories and drew pictures. Some of these pictures are still found in caves today. This time is called prehistory because it happened before people started writing things down. That's why we call it 'pre' history.",5.5,71.0,7.6,8.8,6.7,9.94,3.64,4.4
