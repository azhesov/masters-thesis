Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Nutrition (from the Latin nutrire, ""to nourish""), is the study of food and drink, their chemical composition, and the processes by which the body uses them for growth, maintenance, and repair. Human nutrition is the application of nutrition principles to humans, with a focus on the relationship between diet and health. It is a multidisciplinary field, drawing from biology, biochemistry, and medicine, as well as other sciences. Nutrition research has led to the identification of essential nutrients and the understanding of their roles in the body. It has also revealed the potential health impacts of dietary patterns and the importance of balanced nutrition. However, like physical cosmology, theories in human nutrition may depend upon assumptions that are difficult to test, such as the long-term effects of certain foods or dietary habits.",14.2,43.06,17.9,16.5,16.99,13.23,7.01,18.0

Nutrition (from the Latin nutrire, ""to nourish""), is the study of food and how it affects the body. It involves understanding the nutrients in food, how the body uses them, and how diet can impact health. The term nutrition was first used in English in the late 19th century, as the scientific study of nutrition began to develop. Today, nutrition is studied by scientists such as dietitians and nutritionists, as well as healthcare professionals and researchers.

Nutrition, from the Latin nutrire, ""to nurture,"" is the study of food and drink as they provide or enhance growth, maintenance, and repair of the human body. It is a branch of physiology and a component of health science. Nutritional science explores how and why nutritional processes happen, and how they affect health. This includes understanding how nutrients are digested, absorbed, and metabolized, as well as how they influence the function and development of cells, tissues, and organs. Scientists like dietitians and nutritionists study these processes, along with philosophers of health and bioethicists, who consider the ethical implications of nutrition, such as food justice and sustainability.",14.3,42.85,18.2,16.4,17.29,13.41,7.13,18.0

Nutrition (from the Latin 'nutrire,' meaning 'to nourish') is the science of nourishing our bodies with food and drink. It encompasses understanding what nutrients our bodies need, how they're digested and absorbed, and how they contribute to our overall health and well-being. The study of nutrition involves scientists like biochemists and dietitians, who research and advise on diet, nutrition, and health. They study the impact of food on our bodies, the role of nutrients in preventing and treating diseases, and the effects of physical activity on our health. Just as physical cosmology combines scientific and philosophical propositions, nutrition combines scientific facts with ethical considerations, such as sustainability and justice in food systems.",15.6,34.09,18.5,16.7,17.09,13.64,7.15,18.0

Nutrition (from the Latin nutrire, ""to nourish""), is the study of food and its impact on health and growth. It encompasses the ingestion, absorption, assimilation, and utilization of food by the body for energy, growth, and maintenance. Nutritional science is a multidisciplinary field, drawing from biology, chemistry, and biochemistry, among other sciences. The term nutrition was first used in English in the early 19th century, reflecting the growing interest in the role of diet in health and disease. Today, nutrition is studied by scientists, including dietitians and nutritionists, as well as health professionals, such as physicians and public health practitioners. Because of its broad scope, theories in nutritional science may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.",15.3,34.9,18.1,16.5,17.09,13.58,6.94,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

The term nutrition was first used in 1826 by Jean Louis Prévost and Jean Baptiste Jean Roux in their work ""Recherches Physiologiques sur la Nutrition."" This scientific discipline studies the process of nourishing the body, including the intake of food, absorption, digestion, and the utilization of nutrients for growth, repair, and energy. Nutritionists, dietitians, and other healthcare professionals, along with biologists, chemists, and physicians, contribute to this field. However, it also encompasses philosophical and ethical discussions, such as those concerning food justice, sustainability, and the environmental impact of dietary choices. Thus, nutrition, like cosmology, is a multifaceted domain that combines scientific inquiry with philosophical contemplation.",15.4,34.49,18.9,17.1,17.85,14.28,7.21,18.0

Nutrition, the process by which organisms use food to sustain life and growth, plays a pivotal role in human health. It encompasses the ingestion, digestion, absorption, and metabolism of nutrients found in our diet. This multifaceted process begins with the selection of food, where a balanced diet, rich in essential nutrients, is key. A well-planned diet, incorporating a variety of fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, can provide the body with the necessary building blocks for optimal function. Conversely, a diet lacking in vital nutrients can lead to deficiencies and subsequent health issues. Understanding nutrition and its relationship with diet is crucial for maintaining good health and preventing chronic diseases.",13.5,44.88,17.2,16.0,16.76,13.47,6.88,18.0

The term 'nutrition' was first coined by Franz Karl Achard in 1817, in his work ""Lehrbuch der Nahrungs- und Genussmittel"". Nutrition, from the Latin nutrire, ""to nourish"", is the process by which living organisms consume food and use it for energy and growth.
