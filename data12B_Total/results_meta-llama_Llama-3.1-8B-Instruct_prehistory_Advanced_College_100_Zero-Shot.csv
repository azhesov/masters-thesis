The prehistoric period is a time span that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of writing and record-keeping. This era, which began approximately 2.5 million years ago, is characterized by the development of stone tools, the rise of early human societies, and the eventual appearance of complex civilizations. The prehistoric period can be divided into several distinct phases, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras, each marked by significant advancements in technology and human culture. Overall, prehistory represents a crucial period in human history, laying the groundwork for the development of modern societies.

Prehistory, the period of time before written records existed, offers a glimpse into the lives of early humans. Archaeologists use artifacts, such as tools and pottery, to reconstruct the past. The Paleolithic Era, spanning from 2.6 million to 10,000 years ago, saw the emergence of Homo sapiens and the development of early stone tools. The Neolithic Era, beginning around 10,000 years ago, witnessed the rise of agriculture and settled societies. These eras provide valuable insights into the evolution of human societies and the development of complex cultures. Through these findings, we can better understand the trajectory of human history.

Prehistory is the period of human history that spans from the emergence of the first hominins, such as Australopithecus afarensis, to the advent of writing. It is characterized by the lack of written records, which makes it challenging to reconstruct the past. Archaeologists rely on material remains, like tools, artifacts, and architectural structures, to piece together the lives of ancient societies. The study of prehistory has revealed the complex and varied nature of human societies, including their subsistence strategies, social organization, and cultural practices, providing a rich and nuanced understanding of the human experience. It is a dynamic field of inquiry.
