Prehistory, the period before written records were kept, is a fascinating era that encompasses a vast span of time, from the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing in Sumer around 3200 BCE. This era is crucial for understanding human evolution, as it witnessed significant cultural and technological advancements, such as the development of tools, fire control, and complex social structures. Archaeologists and anthropologists use various methods, including the analysis of artifacts, fossil remains, and environmental evidence, to reconstruct the lives of our pre-literate ancestors. While it is challenging to obtain direct evidence from this period, the study of prehistory provides valuable insights into the origins and early development of human civilization.",14.3,31.92,16.4,15.3,16.1,14.92,6.68,13.0

**Plan:**
Prehistory is the period before written history began. It's crucial to define it in terms of human development, not calendar dates. Explain that it spans from the first appearance of humans to the invention of writing systems.

**Paragraph:**

Prehistory, a fundamental concept in archaeology and anthropology, refers to the period preceding written history. It is not delimited by specific calendar dates but rather marks the era from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the advent of writing systems. This phase, characterized by the absence of written records, is pivotal in understanding human evolution, cultural development, and societal structures. Prehistoric humans, lacking written language, expressed themselves through artifacts, art, and architecture, leaving behind a tangible record of their existence. This epoch encompasses various stages of human development, from the nomadic hunter-gatherer societies to the formation of complex civilizations, and is typically divided into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron",11.9,38.32,13.9,13.9,13.69,14.73,5.65,6.888888888888889

Prehistory, a term derived from the Greek words 'pro' (before) and 'historia' (history), denotes the time span before the advent of written records. This period, spanning from the emergence of the first Homo sapiens until the development of writing systems, is characterized by a lack of direct historical documentation. Instead, archaeologists and anthropologists rely on material culture, such as tools, artifacts, and architectural remains, to reconstruct human activities and cultural practices during this era. The study of prehistory, often divided into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, provides invaluable insights into the evolution of human societies, technological advancements, and cultural shifts, thereby serving as a crucial foundation for understanding human history.",13.1,35.17,15.3,14.2,14.44,14.79,6.23,8.142857142857142

Prehistory refers to the extensive span of human history that predates written records. This period, spanning from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing systems approximately 5,000 years ago, is characterized by a dearth of direct historical evidence. Consequently, our understanding of prehistory relies heavily on archaeological findings and anthropological interpretations. These disciplines employ a multitude of techniques, including the analysis of artifacts, architectural remains, and human remains, to reconstruct the cultural, social, and technological advancements of our ancestors during this epoch. The study of prehistory is therefore a complex interplay of scientific method and inferential reasoning, aimed at illuminating the earliest chapters of human history.",13.7,28.23,15.7,15.0,15.9,16.24,6.42,8.714285714285714

The term 'prehistory' refers to the period in human history that predates the invention of writing, thus lacking written records. This vast epoch encompasses the entire existence of our species, Homo sapiens, from approximately 300,000 years ago until the advent of written language around 3,400 BCE in Sumer.

The term 'prehistory' is used to describe the vast expanse of time before written records were created by human societies. This period, which encompasses the entire human journey from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the invention of writing systems, is often divided into distinct eras based on technological and cultural advancements. The Stone Age, for example, is a broad category that is further subdivided into the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age) periods. Each of these eras is characterized by unique tools, structures, and ways of life, reflecting the slow but steady evolution of human culture over thousands of years. Prehistory is often referred to as the'silent' or 'unwritten' history of humanity, as it predates the advent of written languages and thus relies heavily on archaeological evidence and scientific interpretation to reveal its",12.2,43.02,13.7,13.7,14.17,12.71,5.97,7.857142857142858
