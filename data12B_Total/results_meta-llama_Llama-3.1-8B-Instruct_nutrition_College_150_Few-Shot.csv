Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war.

Balanced nutrition is the posture of a healthy diet which makes no compromises with either side of the calorie equation, but asserts that it will meet all the bodily needs.

Balanced nutrition is a term used in dietetics, which is the condition of a healthy individual, at optimal weight, which holds itself ready to resist the effects of an unbalanced diet. Such individuals assert that they will nourish themselves with a variety of foods to meet all their bodily needs. Balanced nutrition maintained while consuming a variety of wholesome foods.

Nutrition is the science of the relationship between diet and health. A nutritional diet is one that contains the right mix of nutrients in the right amounts. Nutritionists study the impact of different types of food on the body and advise on how to maintain a healthy diet. The goal of nutrition is to ensure that the body gets the nutrients it needs to function properly. A well-balanced diet includes a variety of foods from all food groups. The underlying goal of nutrition is to protect human health from the detrimental effects of a poor diet. Malnutrition can lead to a range of health problems, including obesity, heart disease, and diabetes. A healthy diet is essential for maintaining good health and preventing these conditions. A balanced diet is key to a long and healthy life.

Nutrition is a vital component of human health that plays a significant role in maintaining a balanced diet and overall well-being. The underlying goal of nutrition is to provide the body with the necessary nutrients to sustain its various functions. In order to achieve optimal nutrition, individuals should consume a well-balanced diet that includes a variety of essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. 
A ""sin tax"" can be seen as a form of nutrition education, as it aims to discourage the consumption of unhealthy foods and beverages. For instance, taxing sugary drinks can encourage individuals to choose healthier options. Nutrition education is an important aspect of nutrition, as it empowers individuals to make informed choices about their diet. By making informed choices, individuals can maintain a healthy lifestyle and reduce the risk of chronic diseases. Nutrition education is essential for promoting a healthy and balanced lifestyle.  ​

Nutrition is the act of providing the body with the necessary food for growth, maintenance, and repair. A well-balanced diet is crucial to ensuring optimal health and well-being. Nutrition entails the provision of essential nutrients, including carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, which are necessary for energy production, growth, and repair. Malnutrition occurs when the body does not receive the necessary nutrients, resulting in weakened immune systems, poor growth, and a variety of other health problems. To maintain optimal health, individuals should aim to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods from all food groups. Adequate nutrition is essential for the body's proper functioning and overall well-being. It is the responsibility of each individual to ensure they are consuming the necessary nutrients to maintain their health. Proper nutrition is a vital component of a healthy lifestyle.

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Nutrition refers to the practice of ensuring the body gets the right amount of nutrients necessary for its growth and development. Nutrition is the process of providing the body with the appropriate amount of nutrients, which are broken down into macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients include carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, while micronutrients include vitamins and minerals. Adequate nutrition is necessary for growth and maintenance of bodily functions. Malnutrition is the state of being under or over-nourished, which can result in a variety of health problems. A well-balanced diet provides the body with the necessary nutrients, which can be obtained from food or supplements. Nutrition is a crucial aspect of maintaining overall health and well-being, and is often studied in the field of nutrition science. Nutrition can be affected by various factors, such as genetics, lifestyle, and environment. A balanced diet is essential for optimal nutrition.
