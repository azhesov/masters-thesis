A computer is like a secret clubhouse that only you and your friends can enter. But sometimes, there are mean kids who want to break into your clubhouse and cause trouble. This is similar to what happens in computer security, where computers can be invaded by people with bad intentions. To keep our clubhouse safe, we need to use strong passwords, not share them with anyone, and only let our trusted friends inside. Just like we wouldn't let strangers into our clubhouse, we should only download games and apps from places we trust, and not click on weird links or open strange attachments. This helps protect our computers and keeps them safe from those mean kids, just like how we protect our clubhouse from unwanted visitors.

Computer security is like protecting your secret diary from curious friends. You use a special lock, right? Computers have secrets too, like your passwords and personal information.

""Computer security is like having a secret password for your computer. It's important because there are people called hackers who might want to break into your computer and steal your information. To protect your computer, you can create strong passwords and keep your software up-to-date. Also, be careful when downloading files from the internet, as they could contain viruses that can harm your computer. It's like having a secret clubhouse where you don't want anyone else to come in without your permission. That's why computer security is so important!""",8.4,58.28,9.8,11.2,8.58,11.12,4.13,7.125

Computer security is like protecting a secret treasure. You want to keep it safe from people who might want to steal it. In the computer world, the treasure is your personal information, like your name, address, and passwords. To protect it, we use special tools, like firewalls and antivirus software. These tools help keep bad guys, called hackers, away from our computers. We also need to be careful about what we share online and who we trust. Just like we wouldn't tell a stranger where we hide our real treasure, we shouldn't give out our personal information without being sure it's safe. That's how we keep our computer security strong!

Computer security is like having a secret password that only you know, to keep your important things safe from sneaky people. Just like you lock your bike with a lock, computers have passwords to lock out bad guys. They try to guess your password or trick you into giving it away. But if you make a strong password, like using a mix of letters and numbers, you can keep them out. Also, always be careful what you click on, because some things can be tricks to get your password. So, by being smart and careful, you can protect your computer and keep your secrets safe.",6.9,72.97,7.9,9.1,8.45,7.94,4.11,7.571428571428571

Computer security is like having a secret clubhouse where only you and your friends can play. To get in, you need a special password. This password is like a secret knock that only you know. A good password is hard to guess, like using numbers and symbols instead of just letters. It's also important to change your password often, like when you get a new toy. This makes your clubhouse the safest place to play, because even if someone tries to guess, they'll never get it right!",7.4,66.13,8.2,8.8,7.79,9.1,4.08,6.375
