Here is the final answer:

Prehistory is old. It was before writing. People lived then. They made things. They drew pictures. They made tools. They hunted animals. They found food. They made homes. They had families. They worked together. They made fires. They made loud noises. They told stories. They had fun. They made friends. They liked life. They made good things. They made bad things. They made many things. They made their world. Prehistory is old. It was long ago.

Long time ago, before we had written records, people lived on earth. This time is called prehistory. We can't know much about people from that time, but we can learn from things they made and used. Archaeologists look for old buildings, tools, and other things that tell us about people's lives. They find out how people hunted and gathered food, how they made clothes and homes, and how they lived together. We can learn a lot about people from prehistory by studying the things they left behind.

I. Introduction
The time before written records started is called prehistory.

II. Explanation of 'prehistory'
Prehistory is when humans didn't write down their stories. People didn't know how to write yet. It was a long time ago. People drew pictures on rocks and in caves. They also made tools and homes. Prehistory was very different from now.

III. Conclusion
Prehistory is an interesting time in history.

Here is the explanation of prehistory in 150 words, written in a simple language suitable for 2nd grade level:
Prehistory is a long, long time ago. Before we had writing, people lived. They hunted for food and made their own tools. They made homes from sticks and mud. 
They made clothes from animal skins. People lived in small groups. They had their own leaders. They made rules to live by. They told stories to each other. 
They made pictures on walls. They made music and dance. People were different from each other. They had different colors of skin. 
They had different hair. They had different languages. But they were all human. They all had families. They all loved their children.

Prehistory is a long time ago. Before writing was invented, people lived on the earth. They made tools from stones, bones, and wood. They hunted animals for food. People also grew plants for food. They built homes from sticks and mud. These homes were like tents. People moved to different places to find food. They walked a long way. They used canoes to cross rivers.

Long, long ago, before people wrote in books, they lived in a different time. This time is called prehistory. It started when people first came to the Earth and ended when people started writing. Many people do not know about prehistory because it is hard to find out what happened a very long time ago. We can guess what people did by looking at old tools and rocks. We can see what they ate by finding old food bones. People from a long time ago were very different from us. They had different homes, different clothes, and different ways of living. We can learn about prehistory by studying the things that people left behind.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' in 150 words.
Prehistory is a long time ago before we had written records. It is like a big puzzle. We can't know exactly what happened because we didn't have cameras or videos to record it. Archaeologists are like detectives. They try to solve the puzzle by finding clues like old bones, tools, and buildings.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, so it will target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 2.
To make this text more suitable for a 2nd-grade reading level, we need to use simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences. Here's an example: ""Prehistory is a long time ago. We don't have pictures or videos from that time. Archaeologists find clues like old",6.1,69.48,7.7,9.1,6.34,9.14,3.48,5.0
