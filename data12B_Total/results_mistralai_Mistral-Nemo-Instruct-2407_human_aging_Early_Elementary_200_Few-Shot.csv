Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Hair grows on a human's head when they are young. It is often black or brown. As a person gets older, their hair starts to change color. It becomes gray or white. This is called aging. Aging happens to everyone. It happens slowly, like a snail moves. When a person is very old, their hair is usually all gray or white. Their skin also changes. It gets wrinkles, like a raisin. This is also part of aging. Aging is a normal thing. It happens to all humans.",1.5,97.8,1.6,6.1,3.98,2.74,2.53,2.1875

Human Aging:
A person grows. They grow from a baby to a child, then a teenager, and finally an adult. This is like a tree growing. A tiny seed becomes a small sapling, then a tall tree. But unlike trees, people do not stop growing when they are adults. Instead, they age. They get older. Their hair turns gray, like a tree's leaves turn brown in the fall. Wrinkles appear on their face, like the rings on a tree trunk show how old the tree is. But unlike trees, people can live for many, many years. They can see their children and grandchildren grow. They can tell stories about when they were younger. Then, one day, they rest. Just like a tree falls and becomes one with the earth, a person's life comes to an end. But the memories and love they",1.8,96.99,2.2,6.3,4.33,3.21,2.64,2.1875

Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?"" But the owl says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose. Maybe it is her egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, ""Is this your egg?""

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words. Here's a sample vocabulary list to help: age, older, wrinkle, gray, slow, fast, time, change, body, hair.

Example:
As time passes, humans get older. They change. Their body and hair change. Their hair gets gray. They get wrinkles on their face. This happens slowly, a little bit each day. Some people age fast. Others age slow. But everyone gets older with time.",1.5,97.7,1.8,6.1,3.92,2.74,2.51,2.1875

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words. Explain that aging happens gradually and is a natural process.

As we grow older, our bodies change. This happens gradually, a little bit at a time. It's like when a baby turns into a child, then a teenager, and finally an adult. But aging doesn't stop there. Even adults keep changing as they grow older. Their skin gets wrinkles. Their hair turns gray or white. They might not see or hear as well as they used to. These changes are normal. They happen to everyone as they get older. It's a natural process, just like how a seed grows into a plant.",1.6,97.4,1.8,6.3,4.13,2.68,2.55,2.1875

They start as babies. Then they grow into children, teens, and adults. Their bodies change. They get taller and stronger. Their hair grows. But as they get older, their bodies change again. Their skin gets wrinkled. Their hair turns gray or white. They may not see or hear as well. They might walk slower. All these changes show that they are aging. One day, they will become elders. But everyone ages at their own speed.",1.3,98.11,1.5,5.8,3.73,2.5,2.4,2.1875
