Nutrition is the study of how the food we eat affects our bodies. The food we eat provides the energy and nutrients our bodies need to function properly. The three main groups of nutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates are found in foods like fruits, vegetables, and grains. They provide energy for the body. Proteins are found in foods like meat, eggs, and dairy products. They help build and repair tissues in the body. Fats are found in foods like oils and nuts. They help the body absorb certain vitamins and minerals. A balanced diet includes a variety of foods from all three groups. This helps ensure that the body gets all the nutrients it needs to stay healthy. Eating a balanced diet also helps prevent chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes.

Nutrition refers to the process by which the body obtains and utilizes nutrients from food to sustain growth, repair tissues, and maintain overall health. Nutrients are substances that provide energy, support growth and development, and regulate various bodily functions. They can be classified into two main categories: macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, are required in large quantities to provide energy and support growth and development. Micronutrients, including vitamins and minerals, are needed in smaller amounts to regulate various bodily functions and maintain optimal health. A balanced diet that includes a variety of foods from all food groups can provide the body with the necessary nutrients to function properly. Adequate nutrition is essential for maintaining energy levels, supporting immune function, and reducing the risk of chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes",10.8,46.47,13.5,13.9,13.05,14.44,5.77,8.142857142857142

Nutrition is the process by which living organisms obtain and use the energy and nutrients they need to survive. It involves the intake of food and water, the breakdown of food into smaller molecules, and the use of these molecules for energy and growth. Good nutrition is essential for maintaining good health, and it plays a critical role in preventing many diseases. The food we eat provides the body with the nutrients it needs to function properly, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These nutrients are broken down into simpler forms and then used to fuel the body's various processes, such as muscle contraction and brain function.
