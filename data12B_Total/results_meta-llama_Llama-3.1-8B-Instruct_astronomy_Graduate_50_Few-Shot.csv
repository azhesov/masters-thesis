Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities.

Astronomy (from Greek astron, ""star"" and nomos, ""law"" or ""science""), is the study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. Astronomers study stars, galaxies, and the universe's origin and evolution. This field has led to numerous breakthroughs and discoveries in physics and space exploration.  The study of astronomy has been ongoing for thousands of years, dating back to ancient civilizations. Ancient Greeks like Hipparchus and Ptolemy made significant contributions to the field.  They developed the geocentric model, which placed Earth at the center of the universe.  The discovery of the telescope in the 17th century revolutionized the field.  Modern astronomy has led to a deeper understanding of the universe and its mysteries.  Astronomers continue to study the universe, seeking answers to questions about the cosmos.  Their research has led to numerous breakthroughs in fields such as cosmology, exoplanetary science",12.5,47.62,15.9,15.1,15.21,13.47,6.38,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Astronomy is the scholarly study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. Astronomers examine stars, planets, galaxies, and other objects in our universe using a variety of methods, including telescopes and spacecraft. Their research helps us understand the origins and evolution of the cosmos.  Astronomers can make predictions and models to test their theories and refine their understanding. They often collaborate with other scientists in fields like astrophysics and planetary science to advance our knowledge of the universe. Their work is essential to our understanding of the universe and its many mysteries.  By studying astronomy, we can learn more about the universe and its many wonders.  They use mathematics and computational methods to analyze data and make new discoveries. The study of astronomy has also led to numerous technological innovations, including GPS and satellite communications.  Astronomers continue to make new discoveries and push the boundaries of our understanding of the universe.  They often use computer simulations to model complex astronomical phenomena",13.6,39.26,16.0,15.5,15.38,13.87,6.42,18.0

Astronomy, the study of celestial objects and phenomena, has been the subject of human curiosity for centuries. From ancient civilizations to modern-day scientists, astronomers have sought to understand the workings of the universe, from the motion of planets to the birth and death of stars. Theories abound. Theories abound. Some seek to explain the universe's origin, while others attempt to predict its ultimate fate.  Scientific inquiry continues to uncover new insights and spark ongoing debate.  Cosmological models have been formulated and tested.   The study of astronomy has led to a deeper understanding of the universe and its many mysteries.  It is a field of ongoing research and discovery. The discipline encompasses the study of celestial mechanics, planetary science, and stellar evolution, among other areas.
