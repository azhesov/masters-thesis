Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war.

Computer security is a posture of a system or group of systems which makes no vulnerability to either side of a cyber attack, but asserts that it will protect itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include network security, access control, and cryptography, all of which are measures that are used to counter with force any hacking or malware attack. A system that is armed with computer security is always ready to resist by force any malicious activity of either cyber belligerent. Such systems assert that they will defend themselves against resulting data breaches or system intrusions from all parties. Armed computer security is a term used in the field of information technology, which is the condition of a secure system, at risk, which holds itself ready to resist by force any cyber threat. The goal of computer security is to maintain a state of security while keeping the system prepared to counter any attack.

Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Active defense, in computer security, is a posture of a system or network that actively monitors and responds to potential security threats, rather than simply relying on passive security measures. This may include:
Implementing intrusion detection systems (IDS) and intrusion prevention systems (IPS) to identify and block malicious traffic;
Deploying firewalls and other network security appliances to filter and control network traffic;
Active defense is a term used in computer security, which is the condition of a system or network that actively monitors and responds to potential security threats. Such systems assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties. In other words, a system under active defense is ready to counter with measures any attack that may occur. Active defense aims to prevent attacks by detecting and blocking threats early on. This posture allows a system to maintain its security posture and protect its resources from unauthorized access. In essence, active defense is a proactive approach to computer security.

Armed neutrality in computer security means that a system or network maintains its neutrality by being prepared to defend itself against any type of attack or malicious activity. This is achieved through a combination of preventive measures, such as firewalls and intrusion detection systems, as well as reactive measures, like incident response plans and antivirus software. Armed neutrality in computer security is not about taking a side, but rather about being prepared to defend against any potential threat. This posture allows a system or network to maintain its neutrality while still being protected from cyber attacks and malicious activities. By being armed with the necessary security measures, a system or network can effectively defend itself and maintain its integrity. Armed neutrality in computer security is a proactive approach to protecting against cyber threats.

Computer security, also known as cyber security, is a posture adopted by entities to protect their computer systems and networks from cyber threats. This posture is characterized by readiness to counter with technology and measures any intrusion or hacking attempt by malicious actors. The underlying goal for computer security is to defend against unauthorized access to sensitive data and maintain confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems and networks. A computer security posture can be adopted without making any alliance with a particular entity or interest group. It is the condition of a secure state, at risk, which holds itself ready to resist by technology any cyber aggression of malicious actors. Such entities assert that they will defend themselves against resulting cyber threats from all parties. This posture is maintained while security measures are kept available and up to date. The computer security posture is a crucial aspect of modern digital society.
