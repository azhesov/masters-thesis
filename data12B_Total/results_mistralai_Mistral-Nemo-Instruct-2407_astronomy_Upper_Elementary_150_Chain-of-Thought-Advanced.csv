Astronomy is the study of the universe and everything in it. It includes planets, stars, galaxies, and even black holes. Scientists who study these things are called astronomers. They use powerful telescopes to look at the sky. Some look at the visible light we see, while others see other types of light, like infrared or X-rays. By studying the universe, astronomers help us understand how it all works and where it came from. They also help us find new planets that might be suitable for life. Isn't that amazing?

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It includes the observation of stars, planets, galaxies, and other bodies in the universe. Astronomy also explores the physical properties and evolution of these objects. This field uses many scientific methods, such as mathematics, physics, and chemistry. Astronomy helps us understand the universe's origin and its vastness, as well as our place within it.

Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and other objects in space. It's like looking at the night sky with a really big magnifying glass. We use special telescopes to see things that are very far away. Astronomy helps us understand how things in space work and how they affect each other. It's like a big puzzle, and scientists work together to figure it out.
