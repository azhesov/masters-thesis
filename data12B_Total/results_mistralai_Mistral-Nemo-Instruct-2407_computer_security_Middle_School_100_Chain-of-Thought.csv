Imagine you have a secret treasure hidden in your backyard. You want to keep it safe from thieves, so you build a fence around it. But you also need to protect it from sneaky squirrels and curious birds, right? Computer security is like that fence. It's the rules and tools we use to protect our computers and the important information on them from people who might want to steal or harm it. Just like your treasure, this information can be very valuable, like personal secrets or important schoolwork. So, we use things like strong passwords, updates, and anti-virus software to keep it safe, just like you'd use locks, alarms, and guard dogs for your treasure.",7.0,72.56,9.4,9.9,8.8,9.68,4.25,6.5

A computer is like a secret clubhouse where you keep all your important stuff, like your favorite games, photos, and stories you've written. Computer security is like the bouncer at the door of your clubhouse. Its job is to make sure only people you trust can come inside. It does this by checking if you're wearing the right password, and if your computer is clean and not sick with viruses. A good bouncer also helps you fix things if something goes wrong, like if you forget your password or if someone tries to trick you into letting them inside.",7.8,70.63,9.5,9.5,9.0,8.81,4.35,7.428571428571429

Computer security is like having a secret code to keep your stuff safe from others. Just like you might have a locker at school with a special lock, computers use special rules, called'security protocols', to protect important information. These rules tell the computer what to let people do, like logging in, and what to keep secret, like your passwords. A strong computer security also has 'firewalls' that block bad guys, or 'hackers', from getting into your computer, just like a real firewall keeps a fire from spreading. So, computer security is like a special guard that keeps your computer and your information safe.",9.9,54.22,10.9,11.9,9.94,10.67,4.75,8.142857142857142
