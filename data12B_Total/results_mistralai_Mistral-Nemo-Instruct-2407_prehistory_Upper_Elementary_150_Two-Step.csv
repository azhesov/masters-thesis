Prehistory, spanning from the Big Bang to the invention of writing, is a vast period in Earth's history marked by significant changes and developments.

Key events include the formation of Earth (4.54 billion years ago), the emergence of life (around 3.8 billion years ago), the Great Oxygenation Event (2.4-2.0 billion years ago), the Cambrian Explosion (541 million years ago), and the evolution of early humans (6 million-200,000 years ago).

The revised text:

'Prehistory' is the time before people started writing things down. It began when humans first appeared and ended when writing was invented. It's split into three parts: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. In the Stone Age, people used stone tools and lived simple lives. They were 'hunter-gatherers,' meaning they got food and shelter from nature. The Bronze Age brought metal tools and weapons made from bronze. People started living in one place, farming the land. The Iron Age saw iron tools and weapons. Cities grew, and societies became more complex. Once people started writing things down, 'prehistory' ended, and 'history' began.",8.2,58.69,9.7,10.7,8.68,11.12,3.95,8.571428571428571

Prehistory is a very long time ago when people didn't write things down. They used stones to make tools and left behind things like art and buildings. This time starts with the first humans around 6 million years ago and ends when people started writing, about 5,000 years ago. It's divided into three parts: Stone Age (early, middle, late), Bronze Age, and Iron Age. In each part, people learned new things and changed how they lived. We can learn about this time by looking at old things like a small statue called the Venus of Willendorf, paintings on cave walls, and big stone structures like Stonehenge. Even though there are no books from this time, experts can understand what life was like by studying these old things.",9.5,60.65,12.4,11.3,10.55,11.6,4.85,11.0

Revised Text:
Prehistory is the time before people wrote history. It starts about 300,000 years ago when our early human ancestors, Homo sapiens, appeared. It ends around 5,200 years ago when people in Mesopotamia began writing. Prehistory covers three Stone Age periods: Paleolithic (Early Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). During this time, people learned to use fire, make stone tools, grow crops, and live in complex societies. We know about this time through archaeological findings, like fossils and old tools, as people hadn't invented writing yet. Prehistory helps us understand how humans evolved and how our first civilizations started.",11.3,45.35,13.5,13.0,11.22,13.4,5.02,13.4
