Here is the plan to follow:

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'computer security' to someone reading at the Research level.
Computer security, also known as cybersecurity, is a broad and multidisciplinary field that encompasses the practices, technologies, and processes aimed at protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This includes protecting against malware, viruses, phishing attacks, and other cyber threats.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
Appropriate vocabulary for Research level reading includes technical terms such as ""multidisciplinary field"", ""malware"", ""viruses"", and ""cyber threats"". The sentence structure should be formal and complex, using phrases such as ""encompasses the practices, technologies, and processes aimed at protecting"" to convey a sense of comprehensiveness and technical expertise.

Step 4: Revise the paragraph to ensure it flows well and is clear.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'computer security' to someone reading at the Research level.
To explain 'computer security' at the Research level, I need to delve into its theoretical foundations and advanced concepts, avoiding simplistic or overly technical language. This requires understanding the audience's background in computer science and related fields, enabling a discussion of security protocols, encryption methods, and the latest threats and mitigation strategies.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
Given the Research level audience, I will use technical terms like 'access control,' 'cryptography,' and 'intrusion detection.' Sentence structure will be formal and complex, with a focus on explaining abstract concepts and theories. This will involve using passive voice, technical jargon, and academic phrasing to convey a sense of authority and expertise.
