Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

Prehistory is the period of human history that occurred before written records, typically seen as ending in the 5th millennium BC. It is marked by significant cultural shifts such as the emergence of agriculture, the domestication of animals, and the development of permanent settlements.

Prehistory, a vast expanse of time preceding written records, witnessed momentous shifts in human culture. The dawn of agriculture, a fundamental transformation, saw humans shift from nomadic lifestyles to establishing permanent settlements. Simultaneously, the domestication of animals altered the human relationship with nature, forging bonds that persist to this day. This era, devoid of written accounts, is pieced together through archaeological artifacts, which, like the remnants of a moth in a relay, offer glimpses into the past, illuminating the path to our present civilization.",15.0,35.51,18.2,17.1,17.6,14.1,7.28,19.25

Prehistory, the period before written records, was characterized by a lack of historical documentation. This made the study of prehistoric times challenging, as evidence had to be deduced from archaeological artifacts, oral traditions, and environmental changes. However, recent advancements in technology and scientific methods have significantly enhanced our understanding of this era. These include radiocarbon dating, paleoanthropology, and genetic analysis, which have helped reconstruct human history and behavior.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Advanced College), limited to 150 words. Prehistory refers to the period of human history that occurred before the development of written records, typically defined as before the invention of writing. This includes the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, and the time when humans first started using stone tools.

Prehistory, the dawn of human existence, predates written records, encompassing the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. It's a vast era, spanning from our early ancestors' first use of stone tools to the advent of civilization and writing. During this time, humans migrated across the globe, adapting to diverse environments and developing complex cultures. Prehistory is often reconstructed through archaeological discoveries, such as artifacts and fossils, offering invaluable insights into our past. Despite the lack of written accounts, it's a rich and captivating chapter in human history, revealing our journey from hunter-gatherers to the complex societies of today.",14.8,36.12,17.6,16.4,17.09,13.76,7.14,19.25

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Advanced College), limited to 150 words. Prehistory is the time before written records, or history. It is often divided into Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages.

Prehistory, an era preceding written records, is a fascinating and complex chapter of human history. Divided into the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, it spans a vast expanse of time during which our ancestors developed from nomadic hunter-gatherers into settled, agrarian communities. Each phase, marked by distinct technological advancements, offers unique insights into our evolutionary journey. From the simple tools of the Stone Age to the sophisticated metallurgy of the Iron Age, these periods are testament to human ingenuity and adaptability. Yet, the absence of written records makes understanding this era challenging, relying heavily on archaeological findings and interpretations. Despite these limitations, prehistory continues to captivate and inspire our quest for knowledge about our origins and the path we've traversed.",14.2,37.64,17.1,16.4,16.92,14.05,7.0,19.25

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Advanced College), limited to 150 words. Prehistory refers to the span of time before written records were kept. Prehistory tends to be harder to understand than later historical periods, as it lacks contemporary documentation. Numerous books have been written about prehistory, as it involves numerous aspects, including archaeology, paleoanthropology, cultural evolution, and paleoecology. Prehistoric societies often left behind physical evidence such as tools, structures, and art, which archaeologists study to reconstruct past cultures. However, understanding these societies is challenging due to the absence of written records, requiring experts to piece together information from scattered clues. The term ""prehistory"" itself was coined in the late 19th century, reflecting the shift in human understanding of our past as more evidence came to light.",14.8,36.22,18.1,17.2,17.41,14.34,7.08,19.25
