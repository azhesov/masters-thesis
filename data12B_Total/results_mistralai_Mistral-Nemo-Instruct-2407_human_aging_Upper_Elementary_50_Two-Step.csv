Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 50 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by progressive physiological changes and increased vulnerability to diseases, ultimately leading to death.

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 50 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by progressive physiological changes and increased vulnerability to diseases, ultimately leading to death. It's influenced by both intrinsic factors (genetic, cellular) and extrinsic factors (environment, lifestyle). Theories explaining aging include the 'free radical theory', which suggests that damage from reactive oxygen species accumulates over time, and the 'telomere theory', which proposes that shortening telomeres, protective caps on chromosomes, contributes to aging. Lifestyle factors like exercise, diet, and avoiding smoking can help slow down aging.

Human aging involves changes over time, making us more prone to diseases and eventually leading to death. It's influenced by both what we're born with and how we live. Some ideas about why we age include damage from molecules called free radicals and shortening telomeres, which protect our chromosomes. To live healthier for longer, we can exercise, eat well, and avoid smoking.",12.5,36.79,14.6,14.1,14.09,14.67,5.91,15.6
