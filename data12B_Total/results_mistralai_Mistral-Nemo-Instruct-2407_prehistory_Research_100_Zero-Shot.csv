Prehistory is the time period before recorded history, starting from the beginning of human life on Earth until the invention of writing. This period is divided into three main stages: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. Each stage is marked by the type of tools people used. In the Stone Age, humans used tools made from stones, bones, and wood. They lived as hunter-gatherers, moving from place to place to find food. The Bronze Age began around 3300 BCE when people started melting copper and tin to make stronger tools. They also developed farming and settled in villages. The Iron Age started around 1200 BCE with the use of iron for tools and weapons. This period saw the growth of cities and the rise of civilizations.",6.1,74.9,8.0,9.8,8.33,9.09,4.07,6.75
