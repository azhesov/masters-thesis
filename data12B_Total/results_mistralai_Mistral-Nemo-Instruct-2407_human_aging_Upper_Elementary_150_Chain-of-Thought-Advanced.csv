Human aging is a natural process where our bodies change over time. This begins in our mid-20s when cells start to divide more slowly, and our bodies become less efficient at repairing damage. As we age, we may experience various changes like wrinkles, gray hair, and slower movements. Our organs also age, which can lead to conditions like heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. Aging is influenced by both genetics and lifestyle factors, such as diet and exercise. While we can't stop aging, we can take steps to slow it down and improve our quality of life.

Human aging is a natural process that happens to everyone over time. It is different for each person, but generally, it's associated with changes in the body. These changes can include graying hair, wrinkled skin, and slower movements. Aging is influenced by both lifestyle and environment. For example, smoking, poor diet, and lack of exercise can speed up the aging process. On the other hand, regular exercise, a healthy diet, and adequate sleep can slow it down.
