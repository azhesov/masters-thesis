Step 4: Revise the paragraph based on your feedback from the peer review.

Here is the paragraph I came up with:
The prehistoric period is characterized by the absence of written records, thus the term 'prehistory' was coined. This era is divided into three phases: the Paleolithic (old stone), Mesolithic (middle stone), and Neolithic (new stone). Each phase is marked by distinct technological advancements.

And here is the revised paragraph after the peer review:
The prehistoric period, lacking written records, is defined as 'prehistory'. This era is divided into three phases: the Paleolithic (old stone), Mesolithic (middle stone), and Neolithic (new stone) periods. Each phase exhibits distinct technological advancements, reflecting the gradual evolution of human societies.

Feedback and suggestions for improvement:
* Consider adding more context to help the reader understand why prehistory is important.
* Think about using more precise language to describe the characteristics of each phase (e.g. instead",10.4,47.49,13.0,12.5,10.69,13.45,4.82,7.857142857142858

Here's the text of the paragraph based on the plan:
Prehistory refers to the period before written records. Archaeologists reconstruct past societies through artifacts, architecture, and other material remains. This evidence reveals how people lived, interacted, and developed complex systems. It fills gaps in our knowledge of human evolution and early cultures. 

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Research level.
To explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Research level, we need to provide a clear and concise definition that highlights the key aspects of this period. We should also consider using technical terms and concepts that are familiar to researchers in the field.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For a Research-level audience, we can use more complex vocabulary and sentence structures to convey a higher level of sophistication and technical expertise. We should also avoid using overly simplistic language or definitions that might be too broad or vague.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Research level.
To explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Research level, I would need to consider their advanced understanding of historical and archaeological concepts. This means avoiding overly simplistic definitions and focusing on the nuanced aspects of prehistory, such as the period before written records, the methods used to study it, and its significance in understanding human evolution and culture.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For a Research-level audience, I would use technical terms like ""prehistoric era,"" ""archaeological evidence,"" and ""paleoanthropological research."" I would also use complex sentence structures to convey the depth and intricacy of the subject matter. This might include clauses that provide additional information or qualifications, as well as precise vocabulary to describe the era and its study.",12.2,37.4,14.2,13.3,12.57,14.61,5.44,8.428571428571429

Prehistory, often misunderstood as a period of nothingness, is actually a time of great discovery and exploration. Human ancestors, such as Homo sapiens and Homo erectus, traversed the globe, leaving behind artifacts that reveal their lives and cultures. These remnants offer a glimpse into a bygone era.
Step 4: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. 
Prehistory, often misconceived as a void in human knowledge, is actually a rich tapestry of discovery and exploration. Human ancestors, such as Homo sapiens and Homo erectus, migrated across the globe, leaving behind a trail of artifacts that reveal their lives, cultures, and technological advancements. From ancient tools to elaborate art, these remnants offer a glimpse into a bygone era, allowing us to reconstruct the lives of our ancestors and understand the complexities of human history.

Prehistory, a period before written records, is often divided into several distinct eras.  The Paleolithic Era, characterized by the development of stone tools, spans from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago. This era is marked by a gradual shift from a nomadic lifestyle to a more sedentary one. The Mesolithic Era, marked by the development of microliths, occurs between 10,000 and 5,000 years ago.  This era is characterized by the increasing complexity of human societies and the development of more sophisticated tools. The Neolithic Era, which spans from 5,000 to 2,000 years ago, is marked by the domestication of plants and animals, the development of settled agriculture, and the emergence of more complex societies. The Chalcolithic Era, which spans from 4,000 to 2,000 years ago, is marked by the introduction of metalworking and the development of more",9.4,55.54,11.3,12.4,11.37,11.95,4.9,6.875
