Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by a progressive decline in physiological functions, leading to an increased risk of age-related diseases and ultimately, death. The mechanisms underlying aging are not fully understood, but theories such as the free radical theory, telomere theory, and inflammation theory provide insights into its causes. The free radical theory suggests that oxidative damage from reactive oxygen species (ROS) accumulated over time contributes to aging. The telomere theory proposes that the progressive shortening of telomeres, protective caps on chromosomes, limits cellular lifespan. The inflammation theory posits that chronic, low-grade inflammation promotes aging. Lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise, and stress management, can modulate the aging process, while interventions targeting molecular pathways, like senolytics, show promise in extending healthspan and lifespan.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Early Elementary and limit the output to 200 words:

Summary: Aging is when our body gets older and stops working as well. This happens slowly over time. Scientists have ideas about why this happens, like when tiny, bad things called free radicals hurt our cells and when tiny parts of our cells get shorter. They also think that being a little bit sick all the time can make us age faster. We can help our bodies age better by eating healthy, exercising, and managing stress. Some medicines might also help, but we can't stop aging completely. Scientists are still learning about aging to help us live healthier, longer lives.",11.2,45.56,13.6,13.5,12.55,13.98,5.73,15.0

Rewritten Text:

What is human aging? It's when our bodies get older and start working less well. This happens bit by bit, over many years. It's caused by things we're born with, like our genes, and things we do, like eating and exercising. You might start seeing changes around when you're middle-aged. These changes make us more likely to get sick. Scientists are working to find ways to help us live longer and stay healthier. They're looking at things like eating less and exercising more. They're also studying parts inside our cells that might help us age better. But right now, no one has found a way to make us young again.",8.6,57.77,11.2,11.7,11.79,12.87,5.17,10.714285714285714
