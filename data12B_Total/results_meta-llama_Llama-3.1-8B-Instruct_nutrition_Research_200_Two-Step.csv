Nutrition is the study of the relationship between diet and health. It encompasses the consumption of nutrients, which are substances that provide energy and sustain life. The primary nutrients are carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Carbohydrates provide energy, proteins are essential for growth and repair, fats facilitate the absorption of vitamins, vitamins regulate various bodily functions, and minerals maintain healthy tissues.

Adequate nutrition is vital for maintaining optimal health. It involves consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods from all food groups. A well-balanced diet provides the necessary nutrients for growth, development, and maintenance of bodily functions. Malnutrition, on the other hand, can lead to a range of health problems, including obesity, diabetes, and heart disease.

Nutrition also plays a critical role in maintaining optimal health during different life stages.
