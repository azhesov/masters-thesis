As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 150 words.  In 2020, we began to notice that humans are getting older. People are living longer than ever before. When our ancestors were growing up, it was not common to see someone over 60 years old. But now, many people live well into their 70s, 80s, and even 90s. This change is happening for many reasons. One reason is that people have better access to food and water, which helps our bodies stay healthy. Another reason is that we have discovered many new medicines to cure diseases and make us stronger. As a result, people can work longer, learn new things, and enjoy life more. We are learning more about human aging and how to make the most of this extra time.

Here's my paragraph:

As people grow older, they begin to notice changes in their bodies. They may lose some of their strength and agility, and find it harder to do things they used to do with ease. They may also notice that their skin starts to wrinkle and their hair begins to turn gray. This is because their bodies are made up of tiny cells, and as time passes, these cells start to wear out. The good news is that many people live long and healthy lives, and some even remain active and vital well into their golden years. By taking care of themselves and making healthy choices, people can help their bodies stay strong and resilient. In fact, some people become wiser and more experienced as they age, and they often become leaders and mentors in their communities. This is something to celebrate, not fear.",6.3,79.9,8.5,8.9,8.61,8.12,4.34,7.142857142857142

As humans age, their bodies undergo significant changes. They begin to stand out, not for their accomplishments, but for their physical changes. Women may notice wrinkles, gray hair, or a loss of flexibility. Men may lose muscle mass or experience a decrease in their ability to produce certain hormones. These changes can happen gradually, so it is easy to ignore them. However, with age, people may also become more knowledgeable and wise. They have had more time to learn from their experiences and make connections between the past and the present. Eventually, they may be recognized as leaders, just like Johnson was in the story. People may increasingly rely on them to have the answers they need. In this way, human aging can be seen as a journey of growth and wisdom.  Reading Level: 7.0 Grade Level: 5-6

As people grow older, they start to notice changes in their bodies. They may find it harder to run or jump, and their energy levels may decrease. At the same time, they may start to notice that their muscles are becoming less strong and their reflexes are slowing down. This is because our bodies have natural growth patterns that begin to slow down as we age. We can also notice changes in our minds, like difficulty in remembering certain things or learning new skills. As we age, our brains may not be as sharp, but that doesn't mean we can't keep learning. Many people continue to learn new things and stay mentally active well into their old age. With time and patience, older adults can find new ways to stay healthy and happy.

As our bodies grow older, we begin to notice changes. Our bones become lighter and more brittle. Our muscles lose some of their strength. Our skin starts to wrinkle and loses some of its elasticity. This is natural. Our bodies are constantly growing and repairing themselves, but as we age, this process slows down. We can't just stop the clock and say, ""I don't want to get older."" Aging is a part of life, and we must accept it. It's also a time to learn and appreciate the things we have. Some older people have more wisdom and experience than younger people. They can teach us about life, and we can learn from them. So, let's not fear aging, but rather, let's appreciate the wisdom and experience that comes with it. It will help us grow.  I will be grateful for the wisdom and experience you have to share with me.",6.6,73.68,7.3,9.1,7.96,7.59,3.99,7.142857142857142

As people get older, they begin to notice changes in their bodies. They might feel tired more often and their muscles get weaker. Their skin starts to wrinkle and lose some of its firmness. Eyesight may not be as sharp as it used to be. Hair may start to gray or even fall out. The brain also changes, and people may have trouble remembering things. All of these changes happen because of something called human aging. It's a natural process that happens to everyone. It's like a big transformation that our bodies go through as we get older. It's not something to be afraid of, but rather something to be accepted. And even though our bodies change, we can still do many things we love, and stay active and happy throughout our lives. It's just a different chapter in life.

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Human aging is a natural process that happens to everyone. It is a time of growth, but also of change. As we grow older, our bodies undergo various transformations. Our bones and muscles grow stronger and more developed. Our senses, like sight and hearing, become more refined. Our brains become more capable of understanding and remembering. Our skin becomes wrinkled and weathered. Our hair turns gray and falls out. Our joints creak and ache. But despite these changes, our bodies remain capable of incredible things. We can still walk, run, and jump. We can still learn and grow. We can still feel love and kindness. Human aging is a journey, and every stage has its own unique joys and challenges. By accepting and embracing our age, we can live our lives to the fullest.

Human aging is a mysterious process. Nobody is sure how it works, or why it happens. We age when our cells, which are like the building blocks of our bodies, stop working properly. Our cells are like tiny factories that help us breathe, eat, and grow. As we age, our factories get old and worn out. Some parts get broken, and we start to feel tired or weak. It is like a computer that runs slow because it needs to be updated. Eventually, our factories can't make the things we need to live, and our bodies start to break down. This is when we get sick or hurt easily. Scientists are still trying to figure out how to keep our factories working properly so we can stay healthy and strong as we get older. They are like detectives trying to solve a mystery.

As people grow older, their bodies change in many ways. Just like trees, their growth slows down, and their skin, muscles, and bones start to weaken. The trees might lose some of their leaves, and the humans might lose some of their hair. But just like the tree continues to stand strong and tall, older people can still be healthy and active. They might need to take a little more time to get where they want to go, like the older person and their grandchild walking together. But they can still appreciate the beauty of the world, like the big tree in the distance, and enjoy the journey together. With love and care, people can age gracefully and stay strong like the tree. The love and memories they share with their family will continue to grow and flourish.",6.3,79.9,8.4,9.3,8.71,7.94,4.24,7.142857142857142

As people get older, they start to notice changes in their bodies. They may feel tired more easily and their skin may not look as smooth. Their bones become weaker, making it harder to stand up straight and move around. But, like a tree that grows new leaves and branches every year, the human body also has a way of growing and changing. It may not be as strong as it was when we were younger, but it can still adapt and learn new things. As we age, we can also develop new skills and knowledge, like a book that gets more pages and chapters filled with experiences. Just as a tree's roots grow deeper and stronger, our roots of experience and wisdom also grow, making us wiser and more compassionate. This is a natural part of growing older, and it's something to be proud of.
