The period before recorded history is known as prehistory. This era spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. During prehistory, societies developed complex systems of government, economy, and culture. People built structures such as the Pyramids of Giza and Stonehenge, and developed tools and technologies that helped them adapt to their environments. The end of prehistory marked the beginning of recorded history, when people started writing down their stories, laws, and events. This transition occurred around 5,200 years ago, with the invention of writing in Mesopotamia. The study of prehistory is essential to understanding human evolution, culture, and the development of civilizations. By examining artifacts, fossils, and other evidence, archaeologists and historians can reconstruct the lives of people who lived before recorded history. Their findings provide valuable insights into the past, allowing us to better comprehend the complexities of human societies and the impact of environmental factors on their development.

Here is the solution to the problem:

Step 1: 
The paragraph should explain prehistory, which is the time before written records existed, in a way that's engaging and easy to understand.

Step 2:
To target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 15, we need to use vocabulary and sentence structure that is slightly challenging but still accessible. Here is the paragraph:

Prehistory is a period of time that spans thousands of years, long before written records existed. During this time, humans developed complex societies, created tools, and began to domesticate animals. The era is divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. These periods are marked by significant advancements in technology, art, and social organization.

Step 3:
Let's calculate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of the paragraph. There are 56 words, 8 sentences, 105 syllables, and 9 complex words (prehistory",9.9,49.01,11.4,12.3,10.74,12.4,4.57,6.75

It spans from the emergence of the first humans, about 300,000 years ago, to the development of writing systems, roughly 5,000 years ago. This era is characterized by the evolution of cultures, technologies, and societies, but lacks written documentation, leaving it to archaeologists and historians to reconstruct the past. The discovery of fossils, artifacts, and other material evidence has allowed researchers to piece together a narrative of human history, providing valuable insights into the lives of ancient people. By studying prehistory, we can gain a deeper understanding of our shared human experience and the complexities of cultural development.
