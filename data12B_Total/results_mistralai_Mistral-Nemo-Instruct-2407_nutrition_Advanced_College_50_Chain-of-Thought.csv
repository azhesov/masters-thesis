""The science of nutrition, at its core, is the study of how organisms, specifically humans, obtain and utilize energy and nutrients from food. This multifaceted field encompasses the chemical composition of foods, the biological processes of digestion and absorption, and the intricate interactions between nutrients and the body's systems. It delves into both macronutrients, like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, which provide energy and structural components, and micronutrients, such as vitamins and minerals, that facilitate myriad bodily functions.""",13.3,34.76,15.8,15.7,17.03,15.14,6.6,11.833333333333334

Nutrition, a critical aspect of human biology, encompasses the ingestion, digestion, absorption, and utilization of nutrients to sustain life. These nutrients—such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals—are derived from food, providing the energy and raw materials essential for growth, maintenance, and repair of the body. The balance and quality of these nutrients, influenced by factors like diet, physical activity, and lifestyle, significantly impact overall health and well-being.",12.2,37.6,14.6,14.8,15.57,15.02,6.43,10.428571428571429
