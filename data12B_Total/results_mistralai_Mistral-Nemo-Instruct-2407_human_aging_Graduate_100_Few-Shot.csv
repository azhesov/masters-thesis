Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Human aging (from the Latin senescere, ""to grow old""), is the progressive decline in functional capacity and physical capability over time, ultimately leading to death. The study of aging, gerontology, emerged in the late 19th century, with pioneering work by French biologist Elie Metchnikoff. Today, it's a multidisciplinary field, involving biology, medicine, and social sciences, seeking to understand and delay aging processes, improve health, and enhance quality of life in old age.",14.7,41.84,18.5,16.5,17.59,13.41,7.29,18.0

Theories of aging, ranging from oxidative damage to programmed senescence, attempt to explain why and how we age.

Human aging, the progressive loss of physiological integrity, is a complex biological process. The study of aging, gerontology, emerged in the late 19th century. Early theories focused on cellular damage accumulation. Today, modern gerontology employs diverse approaches: the 'free radical theory' suggests oxidative damage drives aging; the 'telomere theory' links aging to shortening telomeres, protective caps on chromosomes; and 'genetic theories' explore how genes like sirtuins and mTOR influence lifespan.",15.1,35.41,18.1,16.6,17.2,13.87,7.09,18.0

Theories in this field range from cellular senescence, where cells stop dividing and accumulate in the body, to the ""free radical"" theory, suggesting that oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species contributes to aging.

Human aging, a universal biological process, involves progressive physical changes and deterioration over time. It commences from conception, but significant alterations become noticeable in the late 20s, accelerating in the 50s and 60s. Key aspects include: reduced cell regeneration and repair, DNA damage accumulation, altered immune function, and organ system decline, such as cardiovascular and respiratory. Understanding these processes aids in developing interventions to extend healthy lifespan, a goal of gerontology, the study of aging.",15.2,35.1,18.2,16.3,17.34,13.93,7.14,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Human aging is the study of the changes that occur in humans as they grow old. This includes physical changes, such as wrinkles and gray hair, and mental changes, such as memory loss and slower reactions. The study of human aging involves many fields, including biology, psychology, and medicine. It aims to understand why we age and how to prevent or slow down the aging process. However, aging is a complex and multi-faceted process, and there is still much that we do not understand about it.",13.9,43.97,16.7,15.4,15.97,12.36,6.79,18.0

Human aging is the study of the physical, mental, and social changes that occur as people grow older. Gerontologists, scientists who specialize in aging, investigate these transformations to understand their causes and potential remedies. Theories in this field encompass both scientific propositions, like cellular senescence, and non-scientific ones, such as the role of mindset in longevity. Despite its shared scope with philosophy, human aging remains a scientific discipline, with hypotheses testable through research.",15.0,35.71,17.8,16.1,16.26,13.64,6.91,18.0

Human aging, a complex biological process, is the progressive loss of physiological integrity, leading to impaired function and increased vulnerability to death. Theories of aging have evolved over centuries, from ancient beliefs in 'vital spirits' to modern hypotheses like the 'free radical theory'. Today, scientists study aging at the cellular and molecular levels, exploring factors such as telomere shortening and mitochondrial dysfunction. Interventions targeting these processes, like caloric restriction and senolytic drugs, hold promise for extending healthy lifespan, a goal pursued by researchers since the earliest days of gerontology.",15.4,34.6,18.6,16.6,17.67,14.1,7.3,18.0
