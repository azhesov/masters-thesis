Computer security is a way to keep computer systems, networks, and data safe from people who shouldn't be accessing them. This includes stopping and responding to cyber attacks and data breaches. There are several parts to computer security: keeping sensitive information private (confidentiality), making sure data is correct and not changed without permission (integrity), and making sure computer systems and data are available when you need them (availability). You also need to know who is using the computer or network (authentication) and make sure they have permission to access certain things (authorization). To keep computer systems and data safe, people use firewalls, encryption, and antivirus software. It's also important to have a plan in place in case something goes wrong. Computer security is important for individuals, organizations, and governments to protect their assets and keep the digital world trustworthy.
