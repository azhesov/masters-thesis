Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 50 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by progressive functional decline, increasing susceptibility to diseases, and ultimately, death. It results from the accumulation of molecular and cellular damage over time. Key factors contributing to aging include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and inflammation. Understanding these hallmarks can aid in developing interventions to extend healthspan and lifespan.

Rewritten text (College level, 50 words): ""Aging in humans is a intricate process involving progressive decline, increased disease risk, and eventual death, caused by accumulated molecular and cellular damage. Key contributors are genomic instability, telomere shortening, epigenetic changes, protein misfolding, nutrient sensing dysregulation, mitochondrial failure, cellular aging, stem cell depletion, and inflammation. Studying these aspects may lead to interventions enhancing health and lifespan.""",16.3,10.7,19.1,16.7,16.55,20.01,6.82,13.333333333333334
