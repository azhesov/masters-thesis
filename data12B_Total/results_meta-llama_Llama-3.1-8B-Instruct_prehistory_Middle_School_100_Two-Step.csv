Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down. It began about 2.5 million years ago when the first humans appeared and ended around 3,500 BCE when people started using writing. During this time, humans made tools, learned to communicate with each other, and formed social groups. The prehistoric period is divided into different stages, such as the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras. These stages are marked by new technologies and cultural developments that helped shape modern societies. This time period is important for understanding how humans developed into the societies we know today.  (100 words",9.5,49.92,11.7,12.5,8.51,13.44,3.99,8.0

**Prehistory: The Time Before Writing**

Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down. This period began around 4,200 years ago. During this time, humans changed a lot and developed from early humans to the humans we know today. There were three main periods in prehistory: the Paleolithic Era, the Mesolithic Era, and the Neolithic Era. Each era had its own tools, language, and ways of living together. Understanding prehistory helps us learn about the first human societies and how they lived. It also teaches us about the origins of our modern cultures.

""Prehistory"" refers to the time before people wrote things down, which was about 300,000 years ago until the invention of writing. This time is split into three main periods: the Stone Age, which is divided into the Old Stone Age, Middle Stone Age, and New Stone Age. During these periods, humans made tools, learned to talk, and created social groups. They eventually built complex societies and cities. Scientists study prehistory by looking at old artifacts, fossils, and the Earth itself. This helps us understand how people lived and what their cultures were like.
