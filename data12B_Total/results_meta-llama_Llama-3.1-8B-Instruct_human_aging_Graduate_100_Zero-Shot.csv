The process of human aging is a complex, multifaceted phenomenon influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Cellular senescence, epigenetic modifications, and telomere shortening are key mechanisms underlying aging. Mitochondrial dysfunction, oxidative stress, and inflammation contribute to the accumulation of cellular damage, leading to age-related declines in physiological function. The interplay between these factors results in the characteristic changes observed in older adults, including decreased physical performance, cognitive decline, and increased susceptibility to disease. Aging research aims to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and develop therapeutic interventions to promote healthy aging. References: [1, 2, 3]  --

Human aging is a complex biological process that involves the gradual deterioration of physical, cognitive, and emotional functions. As people age, their cells undergo cellular senescence, leading to a decline in cellular function and an increase in oxidative stress. This can result in the accumulation of cellular damage, which contributes to the development of age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the mechanisms underlying human aging is crucial for the development of effective interventions to promote healthy aging and prevent age-related diseases.
