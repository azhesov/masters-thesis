Rewrite:

Computer security keeps computers and networks safe. It stops bad guys from getting into your computer and stealing information. This is done using special tools and rules. Some tools are firewalls, which block bad guys, and encryption, which hides information. There are also systems that find hackers trying to get in. You need to update your software often to keep it strong. But, people must also learn to be safe online. This means not opening strange emails or clicking on weird links. There are many dangers like viruses and big cyber attacks. So, security must always be watched and changed to stay strong. Good computer security keeps your data safe and stops cybercrime. It protects you and your stuff from bad guys.",10.6,41.77,12.0,11.9,9.82,14.25,5.11,10.428571428571429
