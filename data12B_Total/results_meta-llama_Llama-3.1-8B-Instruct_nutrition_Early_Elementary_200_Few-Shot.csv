Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird.

The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Our bodies need food to live. We call this food ""nutrition."" We eat many different foods. They are fruits, vegetables, meats, and grains. Some foods are good for us. They make our bodies strong. Other foods are not good for us. They make us feel sick. We should eat lots of fruits and vegetables. They are good for our bodies. We can eat them raw or cooked. Apples, bananas, and carrots are good fruits and vegetables. We should also eat grains. They are good for our bodies too. We can eat them as bread or rice. We should not eat too many sweets. They are not good for us. They make us feel sick. We should eat only what is good for our bodies. Our bodies will be strong and healthy. We can run and play. We can be happy and healthy. We need good nutrition to live.

Nutrition is food. Food gives us energy. But some foods give us more energy than others. Pretend you eat a big plate of pasta. You would feel full and happy. But if you ate a big plate of broccoli, you would feel full, but not as happy. The pasta has a lot of sugar and fat. That gives us energy. Broccoli has a lot of water and fiber. It helps our bodies stay healthy, but it doesn’t give us as much energy. 

You need to eat foods with sugar and fat. But you also need to eat foods with water and fiber. That is why we need to eat a variety of foods. Ask your mom or dad to help you make a chart.

The food we eat helps keep our bodies strong. When we eat, our bodies take in the food. The food goes into our tummies. Then it comes out as energy. The energy makes us move.

The Body's Food: Nutrition
Nutrition helps our body. It makes us strong and healthy. We need food to live. Food is our body’s fuel. It makes us run, play, and have fun. When we eat food, our body breaks it down. Then it makes the nutrients that we need. These nutrients make our body strong. They help us grow and have energy. Our body needs a little bit of each nutrient. If we eat a lot of one nutrient, it can be bad for us. It’s like when you eat too many cookies. You feel sick. But if you eat a little bit of cookies and some other foods, you feel happy and strong. The right foods help our body be happy and strong. Our body is like a car. It needs the right kind of fuel to run. If you put the wrong kind of fuel in a car, it won’t run. It’s the same with our body. We need the right kind of food",1.6,97.4,1.2,6.3,4.16,2.04,2.35,2.1875

Our bodies need food to grow and be strong. Food gives us energy to move and play. Nutrition is what happens when we eat food. Our bodies use the food to grow and be healthy. But some foods are better for us than others. Fruits and vegetables are good for us. They give us vitamins and minerals that we need. Meat, like chicken and fish, gives us protein that helps us grow. Grains, like bread and rice, give us energy. But if we only eat junk food, we won’t get the good things we need. Junk food doesn’t have the vitamins and minerals that we need. We need to eat a variety of foods to be healthy. If we eat only one kind of food, we might not get all the good things we need. So let’s eat a rainbow of foods. Let’s eat fruits and vegetables, meat, grains, and dairy products. That way, we can grow strong and healthy bodies.
