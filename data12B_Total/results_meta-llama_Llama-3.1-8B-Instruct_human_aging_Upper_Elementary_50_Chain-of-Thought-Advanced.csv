That is because their cells and organs start to get weaker. It happens because their DNA, which is like a blueprint for their body, starts to get damaged over time. This is called aging.""
Step 5: Count the total words in the paragraph. The paragraph contains 36 words.
Step 6: Count the total sentences in the paragraph. The paragraph contains 5 sentences.
Step 7: Count the total syllables in the paragraph. The paragraph contains 55 syllables.

### Step 1: Think about how to explain 'human aging' in 50 words.
We need to explain human aging in simple terms, focusing on the basic concepts that a 5th-grade student can understand. It's essential to avoid using overly technical jargon or complex ideas.

### Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, so it will target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 5.
To achieve the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 5, we should aim for a mix of short and simple sentences, using vocabulary that is common in everyday language. This means using words with fewer syllables and avoiding complex sentence structures.

### Step 3: Make sure the output has correct metric value.
