The term 'prehistory' refers to the time period before written records began. This era spans from the dawn of human existence around 6 million years ago to the advent of written language about 5,000 years ago. It's a critical phase in our understanding of human evolution and societal development. During this time, humans transitioned from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled agricultural communities. Key archaeological findings, like Stone Age tools and ancient artwork, help us piece together this vast, silent history. However, without written language, details remain elusive.

**Prehistory** is the period before written records began. It spans from the earliest humans until the invention of writing, around 3000 BCE. This era is divided into three main stages: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. During the Stone Age, humans used stone tools and lived as hunters and gatherers. They developed simple societies, migration patterns, and art forms like cave paintings. The Bronze Age saw advancements in metallurgy, leading to stronger tools and weapons. Complex societies emerged, with cities, trade routes, and specialized jobs. The Iron Age brought further technological progress, with iron replacing bronze for tools and weapons. This period also saw the rise of large empires and city-states. Prehistory ended with the development of writing, allowing humans to record their history for future generations.",7.7,59.9,10.1,10.5,9.22,11.52,4.25,5.2

Prehistory refers to the period of time before written records were created. It spans from the beginning of human existence until the invention of writing, which occurred around 3200 BCE in Sumer, Mesopotamia. This era is significant because it covers the evolution of humans from early hominids, the development of early civilizations, and the creation of the first technologies. Archaeologists study this time period through artifacts, architecture, and other physical remains. Although we cannot read about this era from contemporary accounts, our understanding of it is continuously growing due to advancements in scientific methods and tools.

**Step 1:**
Prehistory is the period of time before written records were kept. It started around 3.3 million years ago when the first humans appeared and ended with the invention of writing, which varies by culture. During this time, humans migrated across the globe, developed tools, and adapted to diverse environments. Understanding prehistory relies on archaeological evidence like artifacts, fossils, and structures.

**Step 2:**
Vocabulary selection and sentence structure for a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 15 might include:
