Prehistory is the period before recorded history began, which means there were no written records. This time span includes the entire history of humans and their ancestors. During this time, humans lived as hunter-gatherers, moving from place to place to find food and shelter. They used tools made of stone, wood, and bone. Later, some groups began to farm and settle in one place. This change led to the development of cities and the beginning of recorded history. Prehistory is often divided into three main periods: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age, based on the types of tools used. Understanding prehistory helps us learn about how humans first lived and how our ancestors adapted to different environments. It also gives us insight into how human societies have changed over time.",7.5,66.03,9.5,11.2,9.19,10.84,4.26,6.222222222222222

Prehistory is the time before written records were made. It's like the early days of humans on Earth when people didn't have books, computers, or even paper. They didn't leave behind letters or stories to tell us what their lives were like. Instead, they made art, tools, and homes, which archaeologists find today and study to learn about this period. We call these ancient humans 'prehistoric people'. They lived in different ways, like as hunters, gatherers, or farmers. Some lived in caves, others built houses. They used natural materials like stone, wood, and bone to make tools for work and weapons for protection. Prehistoric people also made art, like cave paintings and sculptures. All these things help us understand how humans lived long before we could write down our history.",6.9,67.45,9.1,9.9,8.73,10.66,4.09,5.777777777777778

Prehistory is the time before written records, when humans and their ancestors lived without books, newspapers, or any way to write down history. This period spans from the earliest humans to around 3000 BCE. Prehistory is divided into three main eras: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. In the Stone Age, people used stones and bones for tools. They also created art, like cave paintings. In the Bronze Age, people learned to make tools from bronze, a mix of copper and tin. This made tools stronger and sharper. The Iron Age started when people discovered how to smelt iron, making even stronger tools. Prehistory ended when people started recording their history in writing, around 3000 BCE in places like Mesopotamia.",5.8,75.61,8.9,10.0,8.49,10.37,3.92,6.875

Prehistory is the period before written records were kept, often referred to as the 'Stone Age'. This era spanned from the first humans to around 3500 BC. During this time, humans lived as hunter-gatherers, relying on nature for food and shelter. They used simple tools made from stone, bone, and wood. Over time, they learned to control fire, creating new cooking methods and protection from wild animals.

In prehistory, people lived without written records. This means we can't read their stories or learn about their lives directly from them. Instead, scientists study the things they left behind, like tools, art, and buildings. These help us understand how people lived long ago. Prehistory is divided into different periods, like the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Each period had its own special tools and ways of life. For example, in the Stone Age, people used stones for tools and weapons. They also started using fire for cooking and warmth. In the Bronze Age, people learned to make metal tools, which were stronger than stone. The Iron Age followed, with even stronger tools. As time passed, people learned to farm and create cities.

Prehistory is the time before written records, so we have to use imagination and archaeology to learn about it.

Prehistory is a fascinating journey back to the earliest times of human life on Earth. This period starts around 3 million years ago and ends about 5,000 years ago, when people began writing down their stories. Since there are no books or letters from this time, scientists called archaeologists study artifacts like tools, bones, and buildings to understand how people lived. They even study caves to learn about ancient art. Imagine being able to step back in time and see our ancestors using stone tools, hunting animals, and creating beautiful paintings on cave walls.

We use clues from fossils, art, and stories passed down through generations. Archaeologists are like detectives, solving mysteries of the past. They study tools, buildings, and even trash to understand how people lived. In prehistory, there were no cars, no phones, and no internet. People hunted for food, built fires for warmth, and lived in tribes. They communicated using signs, sounds, and pictures.
