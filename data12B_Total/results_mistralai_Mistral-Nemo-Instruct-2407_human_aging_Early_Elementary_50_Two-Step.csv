Aging is when our bodies change over time. This happens because of many things, like what we are born with, random events, and what we are around. It makes us more likely to get sick and can make us live shorter lives.

Human aging is a complex process involving numerous cellular and molecular changes, including telomere shortening, epigenetic modifications, and decline in cellular maintenance processes like autophagy. It's characterized by a progressive decline in physical and mental capacity, increased risk of diseases, and ultimately, death. However, there's significant individual variation in aging, influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and environment. Some people age more slowly or healthily than others.

Revised Text:
Aging is when people grow older. This means their bodies and minds get weaker. They might get sick more often. Some people age faster or slower, depending on their genes, how they live, and where they live. Scientists study how aging works by looking at tiny parts of cells.",9.7,49.41,11.4,12.4,12.43,13.22,5.53,11.0

Revised:
As we grow older, our bodies change. This is called aging. It happens slowly, over time. Our bodies work less well, and we get sick more often. This can happen for many reasons, like what we eat or if we exercise. Scientists study aging to learn more and find ways to help.",7.8,59.7,8.7,10.8,10.58,10.48,5.23,6.555555555555555
