In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In our bodies, we need food to stay alive and healthy. Food provides us with nutrition, which are the substances our bodies need to grow, stay active, and fight diseases. Imagine you're a tiny person living inside your body. You'd need a balanced diet, like a little bit of everything, to keep you strong and happy. This includes fruits and vegetables for vitamins and minerals, grains for energy, proteins from meat, beans, or dairy for building muscles and tissues, and healthy fats from nuts or fish for brain function. Without a balanced diet, you might feel tired, weak, or get sick easily. So, eating a variety of foods is crucial for your body to function at its best!",8.1,75.03,10.0,9.0,10.16,7.25,4.92,11.0

Our nutrition comes from eating food. Food is like the fire that provides the energy we need to live. It's made up of different parts, like vitamins and minerals. Just as the old woman's beans needed the right conditions to be cooked, our bodies need the right balance of food to stay healthy. The food we eat is broken down in our stomach, similar to how the beans were cooked. The nutrients in the food are then absorbed into our bloodstream, like the old woman's coal jumping to the straw. These nutrients are vital for our growth and development, just as the coal and straw needed each other to start the fire.",8.1,75.24,9.8,9.2,10.16,7.08,4.84,11.0

The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.'

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 200 words. The paragraph should:
1. Start with the phrase 'To get the energy'.
2. Describe how food provides energy and other benefits.
3. Explain that some foods are better than others.
4. Mention that a balanced diet is important.

To get the energy that we need to live and do things, we have to eat food. Food gives us energy, helps us grow, and keeps us healthy. Some foods are better than others at doing these things. For example, fruits and vegetables have lots of vitamins and minerals that are good for us. Other foods, like candy or soda, don't have many nutrients and can make us feel tired or sick if we eat too much of them. So, it's important to eat a balanced diet that includes many different kinds of foods. This means eating some of everything in the right amounts, so we can get all the nutrients we need.",7.2,77.57,8.5,9.1,9.05,6.91,4.39,11.0

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 200 words. Nutrition is the process of consuming food and using it to sustain the body. In the body, nutrients from the food are broken down into simpler forms that can be absorbed and used for growth, energy, and repair. These nutrients include proteins, which are essential for building and maintaining tissues; carbohydrates, which provide energy; and fats, which serve as a concentrated source of energy and support the absorption of certain vitamins. Water, vitamins, and minerals are also crucial for the body's proper functioning. The body obtains these nutrients from a varied diet, ensuring that it has the necessary components to carry out its many functions and maintain overall health.",8.8,73.41,11.5,10.5,11.44,8.36,5.3,11.0
