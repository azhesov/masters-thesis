Nutrition is the process of providing the body with essential nutrients needed for growth, maintenance, and functioning. It includes the ingestion, digestion, absorption, and metabolism of food. Adequate nutrition is vital for overall health, as it supports the immune system, promotes growth and development, and aids in preventing chronic diseases. It involves consuming a balanced diet rich in macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals). Good nutrition also entails proper hydration, as water is crucial for numerous bodily functions. Regular physical activity complements a healthy diet, as it helps maintain a balanced energy intake and expenditure.",10.5,41.97,12.4,12.7,13.05,14.02,5.81,6.222222222222222
