Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive, cumulative deterioration of physiological functions, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and ultimately, death. It's influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as cellular and molecular changes over time, and extrinsic factors like lifestyle, environment, and socio-economic conditions. Key aspects include telomere shortening, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and inflammation, which contribute to cellular senescence and dysfunction. Aging also affects multiple organ systems, with changes in the cardiovascular, immune, and nervous systems being particularly notable. Understanding the mechanisms of aging is crucial for developing interventions to promote healthy aging and extend human lifespan.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of College and limit the output to 150 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. A summary about human aging must include the following key points: the biological process of aging, its impact on physical and mental health, and the difference between chronological age and biological age. Aging is a complex, natural biological process that occurs at the cellular and molecular levels. It is characterized by progressive declines in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases. The impact of aging on physical health includes a decrease in muscle mass, bone density, and immune function, as well as an increased risk of chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and cancer. Mentally, aging can lead to cognitive decline and an increased risk of dementia. Chronological age, measured in years, does not necessarily reflect an individual's biological age, which is determined by their overall health and functional capacity. Two people can have the same chronological age but differ significantly in their biological age, highlighting the importance of healthspan over lifespan.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of College and limit the output to 150 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by a progressive decline in physiological functions, increased vulnerability to diseases, and a higher risk of death. It is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as the accumulation of molecular damage over time, and extrinsic factors like lifestyle choices and environmental exposures. The hallmarks of aging include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. These hallmarks contribute to age-related pathologies like cardiovascular disease, neurodegenerative disorders, and cancer.

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. In the process of aging, human bodies undergo various changes at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. Telomeres, protective caps on chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular senescence and ultimately, death. Mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, accumulate mutations and decline in function over time. DNA damage also accumulates, causing genomic instability and increasing the risk of cancer and other diseases. The immune system weakens, leading to an increased susceptibility to infections and malignancies. The body's ability to repair itself also decreases, making it harder to recover from injuries and illnesses. Additionally, hormonal changes, such as a decrease in estrogen and testosterone, can lead to various age-related conditions. These changes contribute to the increased vulnerability and frailty often associated with older age.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of College and limit the output to 150 words:
