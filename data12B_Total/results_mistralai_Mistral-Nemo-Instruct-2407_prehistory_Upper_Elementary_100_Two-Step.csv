Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 100 words. Prehistory is the period before written records, spanning from the origin of life to the invention of writing, around 3200 BCE. It's divided into eras: Stone Age (Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic), Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Key events include human evolution, early tool use, development of agriculture, and emergence of civilizations. Archaeological artifacts and fossils are primary sources for understanding this era.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Upper Elementary and limit the output to 100 words:

Archaeological evidence, such as artifacts, structures, and fossils, provides insight into the lives of prehistoric humans, including their culture, technology, and societal structures. Despite the absence of written records, prehistory offers valuable information about our ancestors' journey to civilization.

Prehistory, the time before writing, started around 300,000 years ago with the first humans, Homo sapiens. It ended when people began writing, about 5,000 years ago. We divide prehistory into three Stone Ages, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. Without written records, we learn about this time through things people made, buildings, and fossils. These show us how people lived, what tools they used, and how they organized their societies. Even without written words, prehistory tells us a lot about how our ancestors became civilized.",9.7,54.73,12.9,12.2,11.44,13.28,5.09,11.333333333333334
