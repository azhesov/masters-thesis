Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive declines in physical and cognitive functions. It's influenced by both intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environmental) factors. Key aspects include telomere shortening, epigenetic changes, inflammation, and cellular senescence. Age-related diseases like Alzheimer's, heart disease, and cancer are more common in older adults. Lifestyle factors, such as exercise, diet, and stress management, can modulate the aging process.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Middle School and limit the output to 100 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. Aging is a complex biological process involving multiple interconnected changes at cellular and molecular levels. It's characterized by a progressive decline in physiological functions, increased risk of diseases, and eventually, death. Key processes include telomere shortening, epigenetic modifications, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. Aging affects all organs and systems, with the brain, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems often showing pronounced changes.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Middle School and limit the output to 100 words:

Key processes include telomere shortening, epigenetic modifications, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. Aging affects all organs and systems, with the brain, cardiovascular, and musculoskeletal systems often showing pronounced changes. Research suggests that lifestyle choices, genetics, and environmental factors all play a role in determining how quickly a person ages. Some interventions, such as calorie restriction and regular exercise, may slow aging and extend lifespan. However, a comprehensive understanding of aging and its mechanisms is still a work in progress.

Rewrite:

Aging is when our body changes over time. It happens at the tiny cell and molecule levels. We get weaker, have more health problems, and eventually die. Key changes include telomeres shrinking, genes turning on and off, mitochondria not working well, and inflammation. All body parts are affected, especially the brain, heart, and muscles. How fast we age depends on what we eat, how active we are, and our genes. Some ways to slow aging are eating less and exercising more. Scientists are still learning about aging and how it works.",9.8,49.21,12.0,12.0,11.82,13.74,5.58,10.571428571428571

Middle School Version:
Aging is when our bodies get older and don't work as well as before. This happens because of things inside our bodies, like our genes, and things outside, like how we live. As we age, tiny parts of our cells called telomeres get shorter, cells stop working right, and other changes happen. We can't stop aging, but knowing how it works can help us stay healthier for longer.",10.0,54.12,12.6,12.0,12.22,12.64,5.66,12.166666666666666
