Poor nutrition can lead to numerous health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. Conversely, proper nutrition can prevent these conditions and promote overall well-being.

Nutrition in research involves studying the relationship between diet and health. This includes investigating the effects of specific nutrients, dietary patterns, and nutritional supplements on various health outcomes. Research aims to understand how nutrients are metabolized, absorbed, and utilized in the body. It also seeks to identify optimal dietary guidelines for different population groups, such as children, pregnant women, and the elderly. By understanding these relationships, researchers can develop evidence-based recommendations to improve public health and reduce the global burden of nutrition-related diseases.",12.4,31.58,14.3,13.9,13.63,16.17,6.11,8.125
