Ensure that computer security is described in a way that is relevant to the field of Information Technology.

## Step 1: Understand the topic
Computer security, also known as infosec, refers to the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and sensitive information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This involves a set of technologies, processes, and policies designed to protect against various types of cyber threats, including malware, phishing, and unauthorized access.

## Step 2: Determine the key aspects
Key aspects of computer security include confidentiality, integrity, and availability (CIA triad). Confidentiality ensures that sensitive information is protected from unauthorized access. Integrity ensures that data is accurate and not modified without authorization. Availability ensures that systems and data are accessible when needed.

## Step 3: Explain relevant technologies and practices
Relevant technologies and practices include firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, encryption, and secure coding practices. Firewalls block unauthorized incoming and outgoing network",15.2,13.44,17.1,16.1,15.14,19.02,6.31,13.333333333333334

Computer security, also known as information technology security, refers to the practices and measures adopted to protect computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It encompasses various aspects, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability. The primary goal of computer security is to prevent malicious activities, such as hacking, malware, and phishing, which can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive information. One of the significant threats to computer security is a 'backdoor,' which is a hidden access point or a secret entrance that allows unauthorized access to a system, network, or application. A backdoor can be intentionally or unintentionally created by a developer, administrator, or hacker, and it can be used to bypass security measures, steal sensitive information, or disrupt system functionality. The presence of a backdoor can have severe implications for computer security, including the compromise of sensitive data,",16.8,9.48,17.7,17.5,15.76,17.52,6.68,12.571428571428571
