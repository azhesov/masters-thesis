Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive decline in physiological functions and increased susceptibility to diseases. It is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetics, and extrinsic factors like lifestyle and environment. Telomere shortening, cellular senescence, and mitochondrial dysfunction are some of the key cellular processes associated with aging. Age-related changes also occur in the immune system, leading to increased inflammation and decreased ability to fight infections, a phenomenon known as immunosenescence. Aging is also associated with an increased risk of chronic diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. While the exact mechanisms of aging are not fully understood, recent research suggests that targeting specific pathways, such as those involved in cellular stress response and metabolism, may offer avenues for interventions to promote healthy aging.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 200 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive declines in physiological functions, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and ultimately death. It is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetic predisposition and cellular changes over time, and extrinsic factors like lifestyle, environment, and healthcare access. Key aspects include telomere shortening, epigenetic alterations, and the accumulation of cellular damage, primarily from oxidative stress. Age-related changes affect all organ systems, with the brain, heart, and musculoskeletal system being particularly vulnerable. Aging also impacts cognitive function, leading to an increased risk of neurodegenerative diseases like Alzheimer's. Despite its inevitability, understanding the mechanisms of aging is crucial for developing strategies to promote healthy aging and longevity.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 200 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive declines in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases. It's influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetic predisposition, and extrinsic factors like environmental conditions and lifestyle. Key aspects include telomere shortening, cellular senescence, and epigenetic changes. Telomeres, protective caps on chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, eventually leading to cellular senescence and death. Cellular senescence is associated with a senescence-associated secretory phenotype (SASP), which contributes to chronic inflammation and tissue dysfunction. Epigenetic changes, modifications in gene expression rather than the underlying DNA sequence, also play a significant role in aging. They can be influenced by environmental factors and may contribute to age-related diseases. Lifestyle factors, such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and stress management, can slow down aging and promote healthy longevity.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 200 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by progressive declines in physiological function, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and ultimately, death. This process is influenced by both intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environmental) factors. Intrinsic factors include the accumulation of cellular damage over time, such as DNA mutations and protein aggregation, as well as the decline of stem cells and the loss of organ regenerative capacity. Extrinsic factors encompass lifestyle choices like smoking, poor diet, and lack of physical activity, as well as environmental stressors like pollution and UV radiation. The study of aging, gerontology, aims to understand these processes and develop interventions to extend healthspan and lifespan. Current research focuses on targets like cellular senescence, inflammation, and metabolism, with potential therapies including senolytics, exercise, and dietary restrictions.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 200 words:
