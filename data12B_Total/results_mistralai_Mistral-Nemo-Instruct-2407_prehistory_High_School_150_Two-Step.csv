Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 150 words. Prehistory refers to the period before written records were created, encompassing human life from the first Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago until the invention of writing systems, which varied by culture and region. It's divided into Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages based on dominant tool materials. Key events include the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa, migration to other continents, development of complex societies, and the Neolithic Revolution, marked by the shift from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled farming communities. Archaeological artifacts, such as tools, art, and architecture, provide insights into prehistory, as do genetic and environmental studies.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 150 words:

**Revised Text (149 words):**

Prehistory is the time before people kept written records. It starts about 3.3 million years ago with the first stone tools and ends around 3200 BCE when writing began. This era is split into periods like the Stone Age (Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic), Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Important things happened during prehistory: the rise of modern humans, growth of early cultures, start of farming, and birth of early civilizations. Archaeologists study this time using things like tools, buildings, art, and other leftovers from the past. Even without written records, prehistory tells us a lot about how human societies and cultures evolved.",9.6,54.93,12.8,12.3,10.28,13.22,4.83,11.166666666666666
