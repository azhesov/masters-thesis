Look up at the night sky, do you see the moon, stars, and maybe even a planet? That's astronomy! It's like a big treasure hunt in the sky. Scientists called astronomers use special tools to study these things. They try to find out how they move, where they come from, and what they are made of. Astronomy helps us understand our universe better. Isn't that amazing? So, grab a blanket, lie down, and enjoy the show up there. Who knows, maybe you'll spot a comet or a constellation! Just remember, it's okay if you can't see everything at once. The sky will always be there for you to explore.",5.0,77.74,5.8,8.8,6.74,6.93,3.48,4.9

Astronomy is like a big game of hide and seek, but instead of hiding behind trees or sofas, the things we seek are really, really far away in space! These things are called stars, planets, and even galaxies. They are so far that we can't just walk or drive to see them. So, scientists called astronomers use special tools called telescopes to look at them. Sometimes, they look so tiny that it's like trying to spot a single grain of sand on a huge beach from really far away! But don't worry, astronomers are very good at this game. They help us learn about the big, mysterious world outside our Earth.",6.6,73.68,7.7,9.9,8.83,8.11,4.19,7.857142857142858

""Look up at the night sky! That's astronomy, the study of stars, planets, and other space objects. Astronomy is like a big puzzle. Scientists use special tools and ask questions to figure out how space works. They even send robots to explore places we can't go! You can be an astronomer too. Start by learning about the sun, moon, and planets in our solar system. There are fun books to help, like 'Astronaut Handbook' by Meghan McCarthy or 'National Geographic Little Kids First Big Book of Space'. So grab a book and let's explore the universe together!""",6.3,69.07,7.4,9.3,7.41,9.14,4.16,4.454545454545454
