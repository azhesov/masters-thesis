""Nutrition refers to the process of providing food to sustain life. It includes the ingestion, digestion, absorption, and utilization of nutrients. These nutrients, like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, fuel our body's functions and promote growth. Proper nutrition ensures our bodies work optimally, supporting both physical and mental health.""

Step 5: Calculate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of your draft using the formula. For the given draft:
- Total words: 48
- Total sentences: 2
- Total syllables: 96

Using the formula:
0.39 × (48 / 2) + 11.8 × (96 / 48) - 15.59 = 15.68

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of the draft is approximately 15.68, which is close to the target level of 15. Therefore,",7.3,60.92,9.6,10.5,8.48,10.59,4.11,6.333333333333333

Nutrition is the process of providing food to our body to sustain life and promote growth. It involves consuming a balance of macro and micronutrients, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. These nutrients play vital roles in our body, from providing energy for daily activities to maintaining overall health. Good nutrition can prevent diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity, while poor nutrition can lead to malnutrition and other health issues. Therefore, it's crucial to eat a variety of nutrient-rich foods, including fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, to maintain a balanced and healthy lifestyle.",8.7,57.47,12.0,12.1,11.33,13.1,5.23,6.0
