""Prehistory is the time before people had written records. It started a long, long time ago, when the first humans lived on Earth. We can't know exactly when the first humans appeared, but scientists think it was around 2.5 million years ago. During prehistory, people hunted and gathered food, made tools, and lived in small groups. They didn't have any writing, so they didn't leave behind any written records like we do today. Instead, they left behind clues like artifacts, which are objects that people made or used a long time ago. Archaeologists study these artifacts to learn about the people who made them and how they lived. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the earliest humans and how they lived before written records existed.""

Here's the paragraph:
Imagine you're an archaeologist digging up a mysterious site. You find old tools made of stone, bones, and wood. But there are no written records to tell you who made them or what their lives were like. That's because this is the prehistoric era, which comes before recorded history. It's a time when humans were just starting to develop civilizations, and people lived in small groups, hunting and gathering food. The earliest humans, like Homo sapiens, roamed the earth thousands of years ago, leaving behind only their artifacts and the land they occupied",8.0,64.51,10.4,10.7,10.14,10.84,4.81,8.0

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level.
To explain prehistory to an Upper Elementary reader, we should start with the basics. Prehistory refers to the time before written records existed. This means we can't find any written documents or newspapers from that time. Instead, we have to rely on other clues, like artifacts and pictures, to learn about what life was like.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For an Upper Elementary level, we should use vocabulary that is not too complex but still informative. We should also use simple sentence structures to keep the reader engaged.

## Step 3: Write a paragraph of 150 words that follows your plan.
Prehistory is a time that happened a long time ago, before people wrote things down. We can't find any written records from that time, like newspapers or books. Instead, archaeologists,",8.3,58.38,9.1,10.0,7.65,10.19,3.68,6.0

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 150 words that follows your plan. 
The ancient civilizations of the world are divided into two periods: history and prehistory. Prehistory refers to the time before written records existed. Imagine you're walking through a forest and you stumble upon an ancient city hidden by trees. You would not be able to know when it was built or who built it because there are no signs or writings to tell you. That's what prehistory is like. We can't know everything about the people who lived during that time, but we can learn about them by studying their tools, homes, and other remains. We can also learn about their daily lives by looking at their artwork and other artifacts. By studying prehistory, we can piece together the lives of people who lived long ago and imagine what it might have been like to be one of them.

Step 4: Consider your audience's needs and adjust your text accordingly. 
In this case, the text needs to be revised to be more concise and clear for the Upper Elementary level. Here's",7.1,72.26,8.9,10.2,8.87,9.1,4.25,7.7142857142857135

Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
This is a time in the past before people wrote down history. This time period is also called the ""Stone Age"" because the people made tools and buildings out of stone. The Stone Age was a long time ago, about 2.5 million years ago to 10,000 years ago. During this time, people lived in small groups and hunted for food. They used simple tools made of stone, bone, and wood. They also made fire, which was very important for cooking food and keeping warm. Some people think that humans first developed language and culture during this time. It is difficult to know for sure because there are no written records from that time.

Prehistory is the time period before written records existed. It's hard to imagine life before written words, but it's true. Before people could write, they used pictures, symbols, and stories to communicate. These early humans lived in small groups, hunted for food, and made their own tools. As time passed, people began to settle in one place and build homes. They also started to farm the land and grow their own food. This marked a big change in how people lived and how they survived. Over time, different groups of people developed their own cultures, languages, and traditions. These early cultures",6.3,68.97,8.4,9.0,8.03,10.3,4.09,5.4

This is what archaeologists mean by 'prehistory.' It's the time before written records existed. People lived in small groups, and they made tools from stones and bones. They hunted animals and gathered food from the land. Archaeologists study the things people left behind, like old tools and buildings, to learn about how people lived. It's like putting together a puzzle to figure out the past. They can learn about what people ate, where they lived, and what they believed in. By studying the past, we can understand how the world changed over time and how people adapted to their environments.""

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level.
To explain prehistory to an Upper Elementary level reader, I should start by defining what prehistory is and then give examples of what it entails. I can also use simple language to explain the concept.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
I will use vocabulary that is easy to understand and sentence structures that are clear and concise. For example, I can use the phrase ""a long time ago"" to help the reader understand the time period being discussed.

Imagine a time before your grandparents' grandparents were born. This time is called prehistory. It's a long, long time ago, before people kept records of their lives. During this time, humans were learning how to survive and live on the Earth. They made tools out of rocks, sticks, and bones. They hunted animals for food and shelter. They also grew plants and collected fruits and nuts. People lived in small groups, like families and friends. They didn't have big cities or buildings like we do today. They made homes out of sticks and mud. Prehistory lasted until about 5,000 years ago, when people started writing down their stories and histories.
Step 4: Revise the paragraph to make it more engaging and to use more descriptive language. Here is the revised paragraph:

Prehistory is a long time ago, before people kept written records. It's a time when early humans first appeared on Earth. Scientists can learn about prehistory by studying fossils and artifacts. For example, they found fossils of giant dinosaurs that lived a long time ago. They also found tools made of stone and bones that early humans used. The people of the past were different from us today. Some lived in caves, while others built homes made of mud and straw. The ancient Egyptians built great pyramids to honor their gods. The people of the past had to adapt to their environments and find ways to survive.
