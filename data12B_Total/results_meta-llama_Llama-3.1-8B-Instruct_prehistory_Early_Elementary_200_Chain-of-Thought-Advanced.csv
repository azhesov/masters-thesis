The prehistoric era was a long time ago. It started after the last big ice age and ended when people first wrote things down. This was a time of hunters and gatherers. They found food in the wild and made their own homes. These people were very good at making tools and clothes. They used stones, bones, and animal skins. The tools helped them to hunt and prepare food. The clothes kept them warm. People lived in small groups and worked together. They were very good at finding food and making things.

Prehistory is the time before written records. This is before our parents, grandparents, and great-grandparents. It is also before cars, airplanes, and computers. Many people lived in caves and hunted animals for food. They made tools from rocks and wood. The people in prehistory were farmers, hunters, and gatherers. They moved from place to place looking for food. They did not have houses like we do. They made shelters from leaves and branches. They did not have schools or hospitals like we do. They taught their children how to hunt and make tools. They took care of each other when they were sick or hurt. People in prehistory were very resourceful and strong. They made their own clothes from animal skins. They made their own food from plants and animals. They made their own tools from rocks and wood. They were very clever and made their own shelter.
