As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

As humans age, they experience many changes. Their skin becomes wrinkled, and their hair turns gray or white. Inside their bodies, cells become damaged and stop working as well as they used to. This can cause health problems like heart disease and diabetes. Older adults also need more rest and may not be able to move as quickly as before. But even as they age, many older adults continue to learn new things and stay active in their communities.",7.0,72.66,8.0,9.2,8.51,8.18,4.25,7.142857142857142

As human beings grow older, their bodies change in many ways. They become shorter, as their spines lose some of their height. Their skin becomes thinner and less smooth, showing wrinkles and age spots. Muscles become smaller and weaker, making it harder to move around as quickly or easily as before. Hair turns gray or white, and some people lose their hair completely. Inside the body, organs like the heart and lungs work less efficiently, which can make breathing and moving more difficult. These changes happen slowly over time, and everyone ages differently.",7.0,72.66,8.4,9.3,8.53,8.64,4.34,7.142857142857142

Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

As people get older, they start to change. They don't grow taller like they used to. Instead, their bodies become weaker. They might have more aches and pains. Their hair can turn gray or fall out. Their eyesight might not be as sharp, and their hearing might not be as good. Even their memories can start to fade. But even with all these changes, older people can still lead full and happy lives. They have a lot of wisdom and experience to share. They can still make new friends and learn new things.

Human aging is like a journey, similar to how Johnson and Ruth traveled. At first, our bodies grow and learn, just like the young women did. Then, as we get older, our bodies start to change. We might not be as fast or strong as we used to be, like how the fields in Bethlehem were full when Ruth and Naomi arrived, but empty later. Our minds might not remember things as quickly, but we gain wisdom, like how Johnson became known for her knowledge and leadership. Aging is a natural part of life, and understanding it helps us appreciate each stage of our journey.",7.3,71.75,8.3,9.6,8.91,7.83,4.31,7.142857142857142
