**Final Version:**

""Computer security, a critical aspect of modern technology, is the protection of digital systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption. It encompasses practices like encryption, authentication, and intrusion detection, aiming to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability - the CIA triad of information security. This field is dynamic, continually evolving to counter emerging threats in an ever-connected world.""",12.7,30.87,14.5,14.6,15.33,15.25,6.25,11.0
