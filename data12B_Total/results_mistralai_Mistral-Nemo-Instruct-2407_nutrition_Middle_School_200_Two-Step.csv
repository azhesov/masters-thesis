Write a summary about 'nutrition'. Limit the output to 200 words. Nutrition is the intake of food and drink to provide the body with the nutrients it needs to function properly and maintain health. This includes consuming the right balance of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). A balanced diet is key to providing the body with energy, supporting growth and repair, boosting the immune system, and preventing chronic diseases. Poor nutrition can lead to deficiencies, obesity, and other health issues. Regular physical activity, along with a balanced diet, is crucial for maintaining a healthy weight and overall well-being.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Middle School and limit the output to 200 words:

Middle School Version:
Nutrition is like learning about food and how our body uses it. It's about knowing what nutrients are and where to find them. Nutrients are things our body needs, like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. There are also tiny nutrients called vitamins and minerals. Eating right helps our body work well and stay healthy. Things like how old you are, if you're a boy or a girl, how much you move, and if you eat healthy can change what nutrients you need. Not eating right can make you sick, like getting too fat, diabetes, or heart problems. It's very important to eat well, especially when you're growing, like when you're a kid, or when you're going to have a baby, or when",9.2,56.15,11.2,12.6,10.38,11.65,4.74,10.571428571428571
