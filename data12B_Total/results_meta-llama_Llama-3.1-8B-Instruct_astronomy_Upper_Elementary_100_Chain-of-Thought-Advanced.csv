Astronomy is the study of the universe. We look at stars, planets, and galaxies. We try to learn about how the universe began and how it is changing. People use special tools like telescopes to help them see into space. They also use computers to help them understand what they see. By studying the universe, we can learn more about ourselves and our place in the world. We can also discover new things that can help us live better lives.
