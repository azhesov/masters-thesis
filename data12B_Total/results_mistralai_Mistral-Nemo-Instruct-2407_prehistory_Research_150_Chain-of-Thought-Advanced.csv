Prehistory is the period before written records were created by humans. It spans from the beginning of the Earth's history until the development of writing systems, around 3000 BCE. This era is often divided into several stages, starting with the Hadean Eon, when life first appeared, and ending with the Mesolithic period, when humans began to transition from nomadic lifestyles to settled communities. During prehistory, humans evolved from their early hominid ancestors, developed complex cultures, and created significant artifacts like cave paintings and tools. However, our understanding of this time relies heavily on archaeological findings and scientific evidence, as there are no written accounts from this period.",10.2,48.2,12.2,12.2,10.68,13.16,5.07,5.888888888888889

""Prehistory refers to the time before written history. It spans from the emergence of humans around 2.6 million years ago to the advent of writing, which varies by culture. During this period, humans migrated across the globe, developed complex cultures, and created innovative tools. However, our understanding of this era relies heavily on archaeological findings and scientific methods, as there are no written records. It's a fascinating chapter of human history that predates the written word.""

Prehistory, a term derived from Latin 'prae' meaning 'before' and 'historia' meaning 'history', refers to the time period before written records. This era, spanning from the Big Bang to the invention of writing, is divided into four main epochs: the Primordial, Hadean, Archean, and Proterozoic. Each epoch is characterized by distinct geological and biological events. The Primordial epoch, lasting approximately 380,000 years, witnessed the formation of the universe, followed by the Hadean epoch (4.6-4.0 billion years ago), marked by the Earth's formation and the emergence of life. The Archean epoch (4.0-2.5 billion years ago) saw the development of bacteria and the Proterozoic epoch (2.5 billion-541 million years ago) brought forth the first multicellular",7.9,59.4,11.0,10.7,9.18,12.22,4.46,5.888888888888889
