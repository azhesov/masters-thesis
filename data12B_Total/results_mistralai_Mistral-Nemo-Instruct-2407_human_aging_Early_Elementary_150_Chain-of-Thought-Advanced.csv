Human aging is when people grow old. It happens as time passes. The body changes, like bones getting weaker, skin wrinkling, and hair turning gray. People may also have more health problems as they age. This is because cells in the body stop working as well as they used to. It's a normal part of life, but it happens at different speeds for everyone.",6.0,69.89,6.8,8.0,5.7,8.27,3.91,4.2727272727272725

**Final Output:**

Human aging is when our bodies change over time. This happens as cells grow old and stop working right. Some parts of the body age faster than others. Our skin gets wrinkles and our bones get weaker. We also might not see or hear as well. This is normal, but it can make daily tasks harder.",4.8,78.25,6.1,7.4,5.25,7.34,3.59,4.8

Human aging is when people grow older and their bodies change. They may have less energy, see and hear worse, and have more health problems. This happens because cells in our body get old and stop working as well. Scientists think this is caused by damage from everyday living, like eating and breathing. There is no cure for aging, but we can live healthier lives by eating right, exercising, and not smoking. This can help us age slower and live longer.",6.7,67.96,7.8,9.0,7.39,9.03,4.17,5.666666666666667
