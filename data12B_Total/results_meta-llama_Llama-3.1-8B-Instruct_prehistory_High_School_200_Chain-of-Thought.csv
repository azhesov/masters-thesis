Prehistory is the time before written records began. It spans millions of years, from the emergence of the first life forms on Earth to the rise of civilizations that left behind written documents. During prehistory, humans lived in small groups and survived by hunting, gathering, and farming. As time passed, people developed tools, language, and social structures, eventually leading to the creation of complex societies. Prehistory is divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic Era (Old Stone Age), the Mesolithic Era (Middle Stone Age), and the Neolithic Era (New Stone Age). The Paleolithic Era saw the emergence of early humans, such as Homo habilis and Homo erectus, who used crude stone tools to hunt and gather food. The Mesolithic Era witnessed the development of more sophisticated tools and the spread of humans across the globe. The Neolithic Era marked the beginning of farming and the rise of settled communities.

""Prehistory is a time period in human history that occurred before written records existed. It began when the first humans appeared on Earth, around 300,000 years ago, and ended when writing emerged in ancient civilizations, around 5,000 years ago. During this time, humans developed complex societies, tools, and languages. Archaeologists use artifacts and other evidence to learn about prehistoric cultures, studying everything from the stone tools used for hunting and gathering to the paintings and carvings created for spiritual or ceremonial purposes. By analyzing these remnants, researchers can reconstruct the lives and experiences of prehistoric people, gaining insights into their daily lives, social structures, and environmental interactions. The study of prehistory allows us to understand the gradual evolution of human societies and cultures, from small nomadic groups to larger, more complex civilizations. Overall, prehistory provides a unique window into the past, revealing the early stages of human development and the foundation upon which modern societies were built.""",12.1,43.12,15.6,14.1,13.55,15.2,6.1,8.142857142857142

Prehistory refers to the time period in human history before written records existed. This era began when the first humans, Homo sapiens, emerged and ended with the advent of writing. It spans millions of years, and its study is often referred to as archaeology. Prehistoric humans lived in various environments, including forests, deserts, and mountains, and developed unique cultures and technologies to adapt to their surroundings. They likely lived in small groups, relying on hunting, gathering, and fishing for food. As populations grew, so did the complexity of their societies, leading to the development of tools, shelters, and other innovations. The earliest humans were hunter-gatherers, but over time, some groups began to domesticate plants and animals, marking the beginning of agriculture. This significant shift in lifestyle allowed for the growth of settled communities and, eventually, the rise of civilizations. Through the study of prehistoric artifacts, such as tools, pottery, and other remnants, archaeologists have gained a deeper",10.7,46.67,13.0,12.9,13.07,13.69,5.6,8.142857142857142

Prehistory refers to the time period before written records existed. This era is often broken down into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods, each characterized by significant technological and social developments. During the Paleolithic period, humans first appeared and began to adapt to their environments, developing basic tools made of stone, wood, and bone. As the Neolithic period arrived, people began to domesticate plants and animals, leading to the establishment of settled communities. The Mesolithic period marked a time of transition between these two periods, with humans continuing to develop more sophisticated tools and social structures. Throughout prehistory, humans exhibited a remarkable capacity for innovation and resilience, often in response to changing environmental conditions. The study of prehistory is essential to understanding human evolution and the development of complex societies.

Prehistory is the time before written records existed. It is a period when humans lived on Earth but did not leave behind the written evidence that we need to learn about their lives. People lived in different environments and developed various ways of making a living. They created tools and learned to adapt to their surroundings. For example, in the north, early humans developed skills to hunt and fish. In the south, people learned to cultivate the land and grow food. The development of tools and agriculture allowed humans to settle in one place and establish societies. Prehistory is often divided into periods, such as the Paleolithic and Neolithic. The Paleolithic period is the earliest, from about 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago. The Neolithic period followed, lasting from about 10,000 to 4,000 years ago. During these periods, humans made significant progress in developing skills and societies.

During this time, early humans developed tools, shelter, and other technologies that allowed them to adapt to their environments. As they migrated and settled in new areas, they developed different cultures and ways of life. Archaeologists use artifacts and other evidence to reconstruct the lives of prehistoric people, including their diets, clothing, and social structures.

Some of the most significant developments of prehistory include the invention of fire, the domestication of animals, and the development of agriculture. These innovations allowed early humans to settle in one place and develop more complex societies. The discovery of fossils and ancient artifacts has also helped us understand the evolution of early humans, including the transition from ape-like species to modern humans.

Here's the text of the paragraph I came up with:

The term ""prehistory"" refers to the time period before written records were kept. This means that the events, cultures, and civilizations of the past that took place before the invention of writing are considered prehistoric. Before the invention of writing, people communicated through art, symbols, and other non-verbal means. Archaeologists study the artifacts and remains from prehistoric times to learn about the lives of our ancestors. By analyzing the tools, buildings, and other items left behind, archaeologists can piece together a picture of what life was like during these periods. This information is especially valuable for understanding how early human societies developed and evolved over time. For example, the discovery of ancient tools and fossils has helped scientists understand how humans migrated and adapted to different environments.

Prehistory is the time period before written records existed. It is a broad term that covers millions of years, from the emergence of the first living things on Earth to the development of writing. During prehistory, humans did not have the ability to write down their experiences, discoveries, and achievements. Instead, they communicated through art, symbols, and oral traditions. Archaeologists use artifacts and other physical evidence to reconstruct the lives of people who lived during prehistory. They study the tools, houses, and other objects that people made and used to learn about their cultures, ways of life, and technological advancements. By analyzing these artifacts, archaeologists can gain insights into the daily lives of people who lived before written records were kept. They can also learn about the challenges and opportunities that people faced, such as hunting and gathering food, building shelters, and developing social structures.

They developed tools, built shelters, and hunted and gathered food to feed themselves and their families. The first humans likely lived in Africa, where archaeologists have found fossils of early human ancestors. Over time, people migrated to other parts of the world, where they developed distinct cultures and ways of life. Despite the lack of written records, archaeologists and anthropologists have been able to learn about prehistoric humans by studying their remains, artifacts, and the environments in which they lived. By examining these clues, researchers can piece together a picture of what life was like for people during this time period.
