Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird.

The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

As we walk, we notice our feet feel a little heavier. Sometimes our eyes see things a little less clearly. And our hair gets gray. But why? The reason is that we are growing older. We are all growing older. Our bodies change as we get older. Some things get stronger. But some things get weaker. It is like when you leave your toy in the sun. The sun’s heat makes it get hotter. But it can also make it break. Our bodies are like toys in the sun. They get old and wear out. But we can take care of our bodies to make them last longer. We can eat good food and exercise. This helps our bodies stay strong and healthy. So, we can play and have fun for a longer time. We are all growing older. But we can make the most of it. We can take care of ourselves.

As we get older, our bodies change. We grow and get stronger, but eventually, we get weaker. When we are young, our bodies are like new cars. They are fast and strong. But as we get older, our cars get older too. They get slower and need more gas. Our bodies are like cars because they get worn out. That makes them slow and weak. But don't worry, it's normal. It's like our bodies are changing gears. When we are young, we are in first gear. We are fast and strong. As we get older, we move to second gear. We are still strong, but not as fast. And then we move to third gear. We are slow, but we are still moving. So, it's okay to get older. It's a normal part of life. We just need to take care of our bodies, so they can keep moving. . . . . . . .",1.5,97.6,1.3,5.7,3.89,2.1,2.41,2.1875

As we get older, we get bigger. But that’s not the only thing that happens. Our bodies change in many ways. Our bones get stronger, but they also get thinner. We grow taller, but we also grow slower. Our skin gets older too. It gets wrinkly and looks different. Our brains get smarter, but they also get slower. We learn more things, but it takes us longer to learn them. Our bodies get tired more easily. We need more rest. That’s because our bodies are working harder than when we were younger. We use up more energy. We need more time to rest and recover. As we get older, we become wiser. We know more things. We make better choices. We live longer. We live better. But our bodies still change. We need to take care of them. We need to eat healthy food and exercise every day. That way, our bodies will stay strong and healthy.

Humans age. As time passes, we become older. We are young when we are small. We grow and grow. We learn and learn. Then we become old. When we are old, we need help sometimes. We need to take naps. Our bodies don’t work as well as they used to. We might get tired more easily. We might not be able to run as fast. But even when we are old, we can still do things we love. We can still play with friends or read a book. Some old people even get to be grandparents! They take care of little kids and teach them things. It’s a special job. When we are old, we can still be happy and have fun. We just need to take it easy and ask for help when we need it. That way, we can enjoy our life and feel happy.

Human aging happens to all people. It is like a big journey. We start as babies. Then we grow into children. As we get older, we become teenagers. And then we become adults. After that, we become older and older. Our bodies change. We might get slower. Our hair might turn gray. Our skin might wrinkle. But it is okay! It is all a part of growing up. Some people get wrinkles and gray hair when they are old. Other people might get it earlier. But we all get it at some point. It is just like the Sun’s light shining on us. It makes us warm and makes us grow. And as we age, our bodies get warmer and our hair gets grayer. It is a beautiful thing. We are all on this journey together. So, let’s enjoy the ride and take care of our bodies. We only get one body, so we must take care of it.

As I sit here watching the clock, I see my grandma getting older and older. It is like a egg in a pan. The egg gets older and older, just like my grandma. When an egg is new, it is soft and delicate. As time goes on, the egg gets harder and more fragile. My grandma is like that egg. When she was younger, she was strong and full of energy. Now, she is older and sometimes needs a little help. Just like the egg needs to be handled carefully when it gets older, my grandma needs to be taken care of. I will always take care of her, just like I would a fragile egg.

Our bodies change as we grow older. When we are young, our bones are strong and healthy. But as we get older, our bones can become weak. That is because our bodies use the nutrients from the food we eat to repair and build our bones. As we grow older, our bodies do not have as many nutrients. Our teeth can also become weak. That is why we need to brush our teeth every day. We need to eat healthy foods so that our bodies can stay strong and healthy. Eating fruits and vegetables helps keep our bodies healthy. Exercise also helps keep our bodies strong. If we do not take care of our bodies, they can become weak and sick. That is why it is good to take care of our bodies every day. We want to stay healthy and strong. Our bodies are very important.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. Here is a paragraph about human aging: 

As we age, we get stronger and faster. Our bones get harder and stronger. But sometimes they also break. When we are babies, we can't talk or walk. We are small and helpless. As we grow up, we can talk and walk. We can run and play. Our skin gets softer and smoother. But sometimes it also gets wrinkly. When we are old, we can't run and play like we used to. But we can still talk and think. Our eyes can't see as well, and our ears can't hear as well. We need glasses and hearing aids. But we are still strong and smart. We can still love and help our families and friends. That is what makes us strong and happy as we age.  - 2019 National Geographic Young Readers: How You Age.

Human aging starts. Our bodies grow. Then they get old. Our bodies make new things. Then they break. Our hair gets gray. Our eyes get weak. Our ears get deaf. Our skin gets wrinkly. Human aging makes us old. We walk slowly. We talk softly. We see less. We hear less. We move less. We sit down. Then we rest. Our bodies are tired. We need to rest. Then our bodies can heal. Our bodies can get better. We need to eat well. We need to sleep well. We need to live well. Our bodies will be healthy. We will be happy. We will be old, but we will be healthy. We will be happy. We will live a long time.
