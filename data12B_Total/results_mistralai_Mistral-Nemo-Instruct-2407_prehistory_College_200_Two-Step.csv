Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 200 words. Prehistory refers to the time before written records, spanning from the earliest humans to the invention of writing, around 3500 BCE. It's divided into three main periods: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Stone Age is further divided into Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). During Paleolithic, humans used simple stone tools and migrated from Africa to Eurasia and Australia. In Mesolithic, societies were semi-nomadic, relying on hunting, gathering, and fishing. Neolithic marked the advent of agriculture and permanent settlements. The Bronze Age saw the development of metallurgy, leading to advances in tools and weapons. The Iron Age brought further technological progress, with iron replacing bronze in many applications. Prehistory is crucial for understanding human evolution, cultural development, and technological progress before the advent of written history.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of College and limit the output to 200 words:

Prehistory, the period before written records, spans from approximately 6 million years ago to 3200 BCE. It's divided into three major eras: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Stone Age itself consists of three periods: Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). Each phase was characterized by significant technological advancements, such as stone tool use, plant and animal domestication, and eventually, writing. Prehistory witnessed the rise of complex societies and early civilizations like Sumer and Ancient Egypt.
