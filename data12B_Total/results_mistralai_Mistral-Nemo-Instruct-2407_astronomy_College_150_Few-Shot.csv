Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere. It is also a branch of physics and a natural science. Astronomers use the scientific method to make observations, develop theories, and make predictions about the universe. They study the physical and chemical properties of stars, planets, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. They also explore the nature of space and time, and the fundamental laws that govern the universe. Astronomy can be both theoretical and observational, with astronomers using mathematical models and telescopes to study the cosmos.",13.2,40.28,14.9,15.2,14.42,13.23,6.06,17.75

Observational astronomy involves collecting data from telescopes and spacecraft, while theoretical astronomy uses mathematical models to interpret this data. Astronomy is a multifaceted field, encompassing various sub-disciplines such as planetary science, astrobiology, and cosmology. It continually expands our understanding of the universe, from the smallest atoms to the largest galaxies.",14.5,31.51,15.8,15.8,15.16,14.1,6.31,17.75

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

In astronomy, a science that studies celestial bodies, telescopes are instruments that allow humans to observe distant celestial objects. Telescopes are used to view stars, galaxies, and even black holes, which are regions in space where gravity is so strong that nothing can escape. The goal of using telescopes in astronomy is not only to gather data about celestial bodies but also to advance our understanding of the universe.",13.1,46.0,15.8,15.2,14.53,12.65,6.3,17.75

Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects, is a field of study that explores the universe beyond Earth. The underlying goal for astronomers is to understand the physical and chemical properties of celestial bodies, such as stars, planets, and galaxies. This may include using advanced telescopes to observe distant objects, or mathematical models to predict their behavior. The practice of astronomy is not solely about observing the night sky; it also involves rigorous testing and verification of hypotheses through repeated observations and experiments.",14.0,38.25,16.0,15.8,15.06,13.35,6.46,17.75
