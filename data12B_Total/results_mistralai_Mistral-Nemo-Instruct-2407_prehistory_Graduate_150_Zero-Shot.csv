During the time period known as prehistory, which spans from the beginning of human life until the invention of writing, humans were primarily hunter-gatherers, migrating across vast landscapes in search of food and shelter. They relied on oral traditions to pass down knowledge, and their tools were crafted from stone, bone, and other natural materials. Archaeological evidence suggests that during this period, humans developed complex social structures, art, and religion. Despite the absence of written records, prehistory provides valuable insights into human evolution and the origins of our cultural practices.",12.6,36.59,15.3,14.3,14.63,15.77,6.58,12.0

Prehistory, often considered the dawn of human history, spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing, marking the start of recorded history around 3200 BCE. This vast period, lasting approximately 298,000 years, witnessed significant developments, including the evolution of human cognition, migration across continents, and the domestication of plants and animals. However, our understanding of this era relies heavily on archaeological findings, as no written records exist. Thus, prehistory is characterized by a scarcity of concrete information, making it a fascinating yet enigmatic phase in human history.",14.0,27.32,16.0,16.1,16.77,16.3,6.7,12.833333333333334

Prehistory refers to the period before written records began, spanning from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago until the advent of written history, approximately 5,000 years ago. This vast era, often termed the Stone Age, is divided into three phases: the Lower Paleolithic, characterized by simple stone tools like hand axes; the Middle Paleolithic, marked by more advanced tools such as Mousterian scrapers; and the Upper Paleolithic, notable for intricate tools and the emergence of Homo sapiens, who created cave art and engaged in complex cultural practices. Archaeological evidence from this period provides valuable insights into the evolution of human behavior, technology, and culture, but it must be interpreted with care, as written records are absent.",16.2,27.15,18.7,15.9,17.02,14.8,7.32,16.75

During this time, humans migrated across the globe, developing tools, languages, and cultures. Key periods include the Stone Age, characterized by the use of stone tools, and the Bronze Age, marked by the discovery of metallurgy.
