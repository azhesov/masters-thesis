Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and everything else in space. It's like being a detective, trying to solve the mysteries of the universe! One of the most amazing things astronomers study are galaxies. A galaxy is a huge group of stars, gas, and dark matter all stuck together by gravity. Our own galaxy, the Milky Way, is just one of hundreds of billions of galaxies in the universe. Astronomers use powerful telescopes to look at these galaxies, some of which are so far away that their light takes billions of years to reach us. Isn't that incredible?",6.9,67.35,7.6,10.1,8.19,8.86,4.25,6.0

Astronomy is the science that studies everything in the universe beyond Earth's atmosphere. This includes stars, planets, galaxies, and even black holes. Astronomy uses math and physics to understand how these objects move and interact with each other. It helps us learn about the history of the universe and how it might change in the future. By looking at the sky with telescopes and other tools, astronomers can discover new things about the cosmos. Some famous astronomers include Galileo Galilei, who first used a telescope to study the night sky, and Edwin Hubble, who helped us understand that the universe is expanding. Astronomy is an exciting field that allows us to explore the mysteries of the universe and learn more about our place in it.",8.3,63.9,10.7,11.2,9.14,11.48,5.06,6.875

Astronomy is the fascinating study of stars, planets, and other objects in space. It's like exploring the giant, invisible playground that surrounds our Earth. Astronomers, scientists who study the universe, use powerful telescopes to look at galaxies far away, comets that streak across the night sky, and even tiny moons orbiting planets. One famous astronomer was Galileo Galilei, who lived in Italy during the 1500s. He built his own telescopes and made amazing discoveries, like seeing the phases of Venus and the four largest moons of Jupiter, which we now call the Galilean moons. Galileo's work helped people understand that Earth isn't the center of the universe, as many people believed at the time. Today, astronomers continue to make exciting discoveries, helping us understand our universe better.",9.8,54.63,12.7,11.4,10.01,13.11,4.89,8.285714285714286
