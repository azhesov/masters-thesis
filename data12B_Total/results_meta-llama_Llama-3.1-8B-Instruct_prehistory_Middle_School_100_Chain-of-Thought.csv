Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. The paragraph should include the definition of prehistory and some examples of prehistoric cultures and discoveries.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Middle School level.
To explain prehistory to a middle school reader, we need to start with what prehistory means. We can say that prehistory is the study of human societies and cultures before written records existed. This is important because it means that prehistorians have to rely on other clues like artifacts, tools, and buildings to learn about the past.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
We should use vocabulary and sentence structures that are clear and easy to understand for a middle school reader. This might include using simple sentences, avoiding complex vocabulary, and providing examples that are relatable.

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. Use the term ""prehistory"" and a specific example to make it more interesting.
Prehistory refers to the time period before humans developed written records. Since people didn't leave behind written documents, we have to use other clues to learn about the past. Archaeologists study artifacts, like tools and pottery, to understand how people lived. For example, in South America, the Nazca culture created large geoglyphs, or drawings, on the ground between 200 BCE and 600 CE. These designs depict animals, plants, and geometric shapes, providing a glimpse into the daily life and beliefs of the Nazca people.
Step 4: Review your paragraph for clarity and concision. Consider any additional details you could include to make the explanation more engaging.
Step 5: Revise your paragraph to incorporate sensory details and a clearer structure.

Here is my paragraph:
Imagine living in a world without history books or museums to tell us about the past. That's basically how early humans lived, thousands of years ago. We call that time 'prehistory.' During prehistory, people made tools from stone and hunted for food. They left behind mysterious artifacts, like fossils and stone tools, which are like clues to how they lived. We can learn a lot from these ancient objects and the people who made them.

The time before written records existed is called prehistory. This time period goes from the beginning of human existence until the invention of writing. We don't know much about prehistory because we don't have written documents from that time. We have to rely on artifacts, which are objects left behind, like tools, homes, and pictures on cave walls. Archaeologists study these artifacts to learn about the people who made them. They can figure out how people lived, what they ate, and how they hunted. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the early days of human existence.

### Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Middle School level.
We need to simplify the concept of prehistory in a way that is easy to understand for a middle school reader. This means avoiding overly complex vocabulary and focusing on concrete examples that they can relate to.

The study of prehistory is like trying to solve a puzzle. It is the time before written records existed. Historians and archaeologists use clues like old tools, pottery, and buildings to figure out how people lived a long time ago. They look at where the clues were found and what else was nearby to get a picture of what life was like. It's a bit like being a detective, searching for clues to solve the mystery of how our ancestors lived before they left us any written records.

### Step 4: Review and revise for clarity and accuracy.
The paragraph is clear and concise, using vocabulary and sentence structure that a Middle School reader can understand. It effectively explains the concept of prehistory and how historians and archaeologists approach it. The comparison to being a detective adds a engaging and relatable element to the explanation.

Step 'think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Middle School level.' 
""Prehistory"" is a big word that might seem confusing, but it's actually pretty simple. Imagine you're a time traveler who has gone back to a point before written records existed. You can't read newspapers, books, or even signs on buildings. This is what life was like for people a long time ago, before they could write down their thoughts, stories, and histories. That's what we mean by ""prehistory."" It's the study of the people and events that happened before written records started, and it helps us learn about the lives of people in the past.

Prehistory was a long time ago, before people wrote things down. It started when humans first appeared on Earth, about 300,000 years ago.
