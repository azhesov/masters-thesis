Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 150 words. Prehistory, the period before written history, is often divided into three main eras: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Stone Age, spanning from the earliest humans around 3.3 million years ago to about 3300 BCE, is further divided into Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age) periods. It's characterized by the use of stone tools, nomadic lifestyles, and the development of early human culture and society. The Bronze Age, from around 3300 BCE to 1200 BCE, saw advancements in metallurgy, with bronze tools and weapons replacing stone ones. This era also witnessed the growth of cities, trade, and complex societies. The Iron Age, from 1200 BCE to the present, brought significant changes with the use of iron tools and weapons, leading to increased agricultural productivity and the rise of large empires.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 150 words:

Revised (150 words): Prehistory, spanning from the first Homo sapiens around 3.3 million years ago to the advent of writing about 5,000 years ago, is the earliest period of human history. It is divided into the Stone Age (Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic), Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Archaeology, the study of physical remains like artifacts and architecture, is used to understand this era. During prehistory, humans migrated globally from Africa, developing diverse cultures and technologies. They formed complex societies, created art, and established early religious practices. The transition to history, marked by the invention of writing, signified a significant shift in human civilization, enabling the recording and preservation of historical events.",11.7,38.82,13.5,14.5,11.68,14.61,4.92,7.625
