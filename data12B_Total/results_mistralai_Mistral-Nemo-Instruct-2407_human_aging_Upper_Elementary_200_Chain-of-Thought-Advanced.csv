Human aging is a natural process where our bodies change over time. As we grow older, our cells divide more slowly, and we start to lose some of them. This can affect how our organs work, like our heart, lungs, and brain. We also lose muscle and bone, which makes us weaker and more likely to get injured. Our skin gets thinner and more wrinkled, and our hair turns gray or falls out. These changes happen gradually, and they're different for everyone. But they're a normal part of life.",5.2,77.33,7.2,8.2,6.07,8.39,3.9,4.9

Human aging is a natural process where our bodies gradually change and decline over time. As we grow older, our cells divide less frequently, and we become more susceptible to diseases like cancer. Our bones lose density, making them fragile, and our muscles waste away, reducing our strength and flexibility. Our skin wrinkles and loses its elasticity, and our eyes and ears may not function as well as they used to. Our brains also change, making it harder to remember things or learn new skills. This process happens to everyone, but it occurs at different rates and affects people in different ways. Scientists are still learning about why we age and how we can slow down or reverse the process.

Human aging is the process where our bodies change over time. Our skin wrinkles, hair turns gray, and bones become weaker. Inside our bodies, cells don't divide as quickly, and some parts stop working as well. This can lead to health problems like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Scientists believe this happens because our cells' ability to repair damage decreases. Also, our bodies produce fewer new cells. This process starts in our 20s and happens faster as we get older. But, eating well, exercising, and not smoking can slow down these changes.",6.2,69.18,8.0,8.3,6.61,9.55,4.11,4.8

**Plan:**
- Define aging in a simple way.
- Explain the physical changes that happen.
- Describe how aging affects daily activities.
- Keep sentences short and use simple vocabulary.

**Paragraph:**
Aging is when our body changes over time. Our skin gets wrinkles, hair turns gray or falls out. Bones can become weak and we may have more health problems. These changes can make it harder to do things like we used to. Walking might be slower, or we might need help with tasks. It's a natural process that happens to everyone.

Human aging is the process by which our bodies and minds change over time. As we grow older, our cells divide and replicate more slowly. This leads to slower growth and repair of tissues. Our organs also become less efficient at their jobs. For example, our hearts may not pump as strongly, and our lungs may not take in as much air. Our brains can also change, making it harder to learn new things or remember old ones. These changes happen to everyone, but they happen at different rates and in different ways from person to person. Scientists are still learning about why and how we age. They hope to find ways to slow or even stop aging in the future.",6.8,67.86,7.5,8.8,6.74,8.86,4.0,5.666666666666667

Human aging is the process where our body changes over time. It starts in our mid-20s when cells begin to divide more slowly and we stop growing taller. As we age, our skin gets thinner, bones become less dense, and muscles shrink. We also become more susceptible to diseases like heart disease and diabetes. This is because our body's systems don't work as well as they used to. For example, our immune system might not be as strong in fighting off infections. Though aging is a natural part of life, understanding it can help us live healthier lives.
