Here's how to explain 'nutrition' in 200 words.

Nutrition is what we eat to have energy and stay healthy. Food is made up of different things like carbs, proteins, and fats. Our bodies need these things to work properly. When we eat food, our body breaks it down into the things it needs. This is called digestion. Our body uses the energy from the food to move, think, and grow. If we don't get enough of the right things, we might feel sick or tired. Nutrition is important for kids and grown-ups. It helps us grow strong and healthy. We need to eat a variety of foods to get all the things we need. This is called a balanced diet. Some foods are good for us, like fruits and vegetables. Other foods are not as good for us, like candy and cookies. We should try to eat more of the good foods and less of the not-so-good foods.

Here is the plan to explain 'nutrition' in 200 words, targeting Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 5.

The body needs food to have energy and grow. Food gives us the fuel we need to run, play, and have fun. This is called nutrition. Our bodies use food to make energy, build strong muscles, and keep our bones healthy. We get nutrition from the food we eat. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean meats are all good sources of nutrition. They have vitamins and minerals that help our bodies work properly. 
The food we eat is broken down into small parts that our bodies can use. This process is called digestion. Our bodies take in the good stuff and get rid of the bad stuff. It is like a recycling program for our bodies. We need to eat a variety of foods to get all the nutrients we need. This is why it is important to eat a rainbow of foods every day.
