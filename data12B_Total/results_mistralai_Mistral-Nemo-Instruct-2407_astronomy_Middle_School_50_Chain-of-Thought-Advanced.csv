Astronomy is the study of celestial objects, like stars, planets, and galaxies. It involves observing and understanding their movements and interactions. Scientists called astronomers use powerful telescopes to explore the universe, learning about its origins and evolution. This helps us understand our place in the cosmos.

Here's the breakdown of the text:
- Total words: 38
- Total sentences: 3
- Total syllables: 70

Using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula:
0.39 × (38 / 3) + 11.8 × (70 / 38) - 15.59 ≈ 8.4

The text's Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is approximately 8.4, which is suitable for an 8th-grade reading level.",7.2,61.43,9.9,10.1,8.01,11.4,4.38,5.5
