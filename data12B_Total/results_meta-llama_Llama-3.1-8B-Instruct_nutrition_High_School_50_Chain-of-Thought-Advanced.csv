Nutrition is the process by which the body takes in, digests, and utilizes food for energy, growth, and repair. It involves the consumption of essential nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, which provide the necessary building blocks for cellular functions. Adequate nutrition is crucial for maintaining optimal health, preventing disease, and supporting physical performance. A balanced diet that includes a variety of whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, is essential for meeting nutritional needs. Furthermore, a well-planned nutrition plan can help individuals achieve and maintain a healthy weight, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, and enhance overall well-being. By making informed food choices and staying hydrated, individuals can support their nutritional needs and promote optimal health. (51 words)
