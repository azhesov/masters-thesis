Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

Most scientific calculators have algebraic logic; the operation in an expression can be entered in the calculator in the order in which the expression is read (left to right). The calculator automatically follows the conventional order of operations. 
You can setup your calculator to work either in natural display or linear display. Natural display causes fractions, irrational numbers, expressions, and certain functions to be displayed as you see them on paper. Linear display causes fractions and other expressions to be displayed in a line. 
When we come across an expression such as 7 + 3 ÷ 10 × 1, it makes a difference how we choose which operations to perform first.
Scientific calculators have been programmed to follow preset mathematical rules. If we press the buttons in a certain order, the calculator does the operations according to the rules that it has been programmed with.

Prehistory, the time before written records, is often divided into three eras: Stone, Bronze, and Iron. Each era is named for the primary material used to make tools. In the Stone Age, people crafted tools from stone, bone, and wood. They hunted, gathered food, and created simple shelters. The Bronze Age began when people learned to melt and shape bronze, a mix of copper and tin. They made stronger tools and weapons. The Iron Age followed, as people discovered how to work iron. This allowed them to create better tools and weapons, and build bigger cities. These eras span millions of years, from the first humans to the start of recorded history.",9.1,61.67,11.1,12.5,10.65,10.44,4.87,15.25

Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (High School), limited to 100 words. Prehistory is the period before written records. The paragraph should include the following content points:
- People lived in different environments
- They created tools
- We know about them through archaeology

In prehistory, people dwelled in diverse settings, from savannas to icy tundras. They crafted tools, like stone axes and bone needles, to aid survival. Today, archaeologists unearth these artifacts, revealing glimpses of past lives.",11.1,51.28,13.0,13.8,12.07,11.84,5.39,15.25

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (High School), limited to 100 words. Prehistory refers to the period before recorded history, before the invention of writing. It includes the time when humans used stone tools, before the development of agriculture.

Prehistory, a vast stretch of time before writing was invented, is when our ancestors used simple stone tools. They were hunters and gatherers, living off the land. No records exist from this period, only clues like fossils and artifacts. It spans from the emergence of early humans to the dawn of civilization. This era is often divided into Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, based on the materials used for tools.",10.7,52.29,11.8,13.3,11.61,11.08,5.1,15.25

Prehistory, the dawn of human life, spanned from the first humans to the invention of writing. It stretched over 99% of our species' history. Prehistoric humans left no written records, but their tools, art, and fossils paint a vivid picture. These artifacts tell tales of their lives, from simple stone tools to magnificent cave paintings. Prehistory ended around 3400 BCE, when the Sumerians in Mesopotamia began recording history.",10.7,52.19,12.1,13.2,11.36,11.31,5.07,15.25
