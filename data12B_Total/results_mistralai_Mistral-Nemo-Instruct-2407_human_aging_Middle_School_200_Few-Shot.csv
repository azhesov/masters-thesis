In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

Aging is a natural process that happens to every human being, much like a bean's journey towards the pan. Just as the bean is plucked from its plant and eventually cooked, humans are born and one day pass away. As time goes on, our bodies change, becoming weaker and slower, similar to how a bean loses its freshness and vibrancy. We might wish to stay young forever, like the straw in the story, but even it would burn up eventually if left near the fire. So, we should appreciate and make the most of each stage of life, understanding that it's all part of our journey, just as the bean's journey leads it from the plant to the table.",8.8,73.41,10.6,9.3,10.74,7.2,5.05,11.0

Human aging is like a slow-burning fire that eventually consumes everything. It begins with the first wrinkle, a tiny line that appears on your face. Over time, more wrinkles join it, like the beans that drop into the old woman's pot. Your hair turns gray, just as the beans turn brown and withered. Your body slows down, like the straw that catches fire but doesn't burn as brightly as before. Yet, just as the old woman's beans needed the fire to cook, we need aging to grow wiser, to gain experience, and to leave a legacy behind, like the veneer that is dried and prepared for use. Aging is a process that we all must go through, much like the veneer passing through the different stages of cutting, drying, and packing.",8.3,74.73,10.2,8.7,9.97,7.25,4.93,11.0

In the vast world of life, there's a tale of a human, like a bean or coal, facing aging. Just as the coal leaped from the fire, humans, too, are born into the world, eager to live. However, like the bean destined for the pan, we are all mortal, and aging, our inevitable fate. As we journey through life, we dry and change, much like the veneer in the drying room.

In a human body, cells grow and multiply like beans in a dish. Over time, some cells slow down and stop working, like a tired old coal beside the straw. They can no longer keep the body young and strong. The body begins to wrinkle, like the straw that has dried out. Bones become brittle, like a broken piece of wood. The heart works slower, like a clock running out of power. The body needs more rest, like a tired old woman by the fire. This is the natural way of human aging, but with good care and a healthy life, the body can stay strong and active for many years.",6.4,84.91,8.8,8.3,9.19,6.67,4.54,11.0

In a body, there lives a tiny cell, just like a straw in our first story. This cell works hard, doing important tasks like repairing damages. One day, a harmful molecule, like a burning coal, jumps onto this cell. ""Where are you from?"" asks the cell. ""I escaped from the body's power plant,"" replies the molecule, ""I was going to be burned up there."" ""I'm also lucky to be here,"" says the cell, ""if I had stayed in the body's cooking pot, I'd be broken down into pieces like my friends."" ""Would my fate be any better?"" asks the molecule. As they talk, time passes, and the cell slowly weakens, like the straw in our story. This is what we call human aging.",7.1,77.67,8.4,8.2,8.62,6.67,4.36,11.0

This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

As the human body ages, it's like the wood in example 2. Once lively and strong, it begins to slow down and dry out. Joints, which were once flexible and easy to move, start to become stiff and painful. Bones, like the veneer, become brittle and fragile. The heart, which once pumped blood swiftly, now labors to keep up. Hair, once thick and dark, thins out and turns grey or white. Skin, once smooth and firm, wrinkles and sags. Yet, like the veneer in the dry room, the elderly body continues to be cared for, kept warm and comfortable.",6.4,85.02,9.0,8.4,9.28,6.85,4.55,11.0

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 200 words. As we age, our bodies face many changes, much like the beans, coal, and straw in the story. Our skin, like the beans, begins to wrinkle and sag, while our hair, like the straw, turns grey or white and may thin out. Our bones, once strong like the coal, can become brittle and break more easily. Inside our bodies, organs like our heart and lungs may not work as well as they used to. Just as the straw and coal had different fates, each person ages differently, with some people remaining quite active and healthy into old age. But like the beans in the pan, eventually everyone's life comes to an end.",8.4,74.22,10.1,8.7,10.25,7.14,4.86,11.0

""Human aging is like a fire burning out. Just as a flame gradually loses its intensity, our bodies slowly decline. Our skin wrinkles, much like the bean in the story, it dries out and changes texture. Our hair turns gray, similar to the straw, it loses its color and vibrancy. And our bones, much like the coal, become fragile and susceptible to breaking. Yet, despite these changes, we continue to live and grow, just as the fire keeps burning, even if it's at a slower pace.""",8.0,75.34,9.7,8.7,9.96,6.96,4.85,11.0
