Computer security helps keep our information safe on computers and phones. It's like locking a door to keep bad guys out. We use passwords to lock our devices. A password is a secret word or mix of letters and numbers that only we know. When we type our password correctly, it lets us into our device. But if we share our password with someone, they can get in and see our stuff. So, we should never share our password with anyone, not even our friends. Keeping our password secret is an important part of computer security. It keeps our information safe and private.  Tweet
