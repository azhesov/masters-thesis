Write a summary about 'nutrition'. Limit the output to 200 words. NUTRITION refers to the process of consuming and utilizing food for growth, maintenance, and repair of the body. It's vital for overall health and well-being. A balanced diet, comprising macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals), and water, ensures the body functions optimally. Key nutrients include:

1. **Carbohydrates**: Main energy source, providing 45-65% of daily caloric needs.
2. **Proteins**: Essential for growth, maintenance, and repair of tissues, contributing 10-35% of daily calories.
3. **Fats**: Crucial for absorbing fat-soluble vitamins, brain function, and energy, making up 20-35% of daily calories.
4. **Vitamins and Minerals**: Micronutrients playing critical roles in various bodily functions, obtained from a varied diet.

Proper nutrition is especially important","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of College and limit the output to 200 words:

Proper nutrition is especially important for vulnerable populations like children, pregnant women, and the elderly. Malnutrition, either over- or undernutrition, can lead to severe health issues, including obesity, diabetes, and nutrient deficiencies. Regular physical activity, combined with a balanced diet, promotes a healthy weight and reduces disease risk.",12.3,31.78,14.9,14.2,13.95,15.65,5.78,8.125
