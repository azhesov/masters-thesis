Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Computer security, also known as cybersecurity, is the practice of protecting computers and networks from digital threats. It includes measures to prevent unauthorized access, use, disruption, or destruction of information. Just as protective tariffs make domestic goods more affordable by making foreign alternatives costlier, strong computer security makes domestic data safer by making unauthorized access more difficult. This is achieved through various means, such as encryption, firewalls, and regular software updates. However, while these measures primarily aim to safeguard data, they also incidentally generate revenue for companies providing cybersecurity services.",13.6,39.16,16.3,16.1,15.07,14.22,6.31,17.75

Protective computer security is a strategy that prioritizes safeguarding digital assets from unauthorized access and damage. Like protective tariffs, it aims to shield domestic technology industries from cyber threats. Unlike revenue-maximizing tariffs, computer security focuses on resilience rather than earnings. It involves installing software barriers (firewalls), enforcing access controls, and regularly updating security protocols to defend against evolving cyber attacks.",13.2,40.28,15.7,15.8,14.72,14.16,6.24,17.75

Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Computer security, or cybersecurity, is the practice of protecting computers and networks from digital threats. These threats can include malicious software, hackers, and even hardware failures. Cybersecurity aims to safeguard both the integrity of data and the availability of systems. This involves implementing measures like firewalls, encryption, and regular software updates to block unauthorized access and prevent data breaches. In essence, cybersecurity is the digital equivalent of a home alarm system, aiming to deter potential intruders and protect valuable assets.",13.4,39.77,15.6,15.4,14.49,13.76,6.32,17.75

Computer security, in information technology, is a posture of protection that safeguards digital systems from malicious threats. This includes measures like firewalls, encryption, and regular software updates. It's similar to having a security guard at a building entrance, ensuring only authorized individuals gain access. The goal of computer security is to prevent unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information.",13.5,39.47,15.8,16.0,15.05,13.7,6.31,17.75
