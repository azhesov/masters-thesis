Computer security is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This involves implementing various security measures, such as firewalls, encryption, and access controls, to prevent cyber threats and protect sensitive information. A secure computer system is one that is designed and configured to prevent unauthorized access, ensure the integrity and availability of data, and provide a secure environment for users. Effective computer security requires a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to protect against a wide range of threats, including malware, phishing, and insider attacks. By implementing robust security measures and staying informed about emerging threats, individuals and organizations can protect their computer systems and data from harm.
