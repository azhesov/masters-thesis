Prehistory, a term often used interchangeably with the 'Stone Age,' refers to the period of human history before the advent of writing. This era, spanning from the first appearance of Homo sapiens to the development of early civilizations, is characterized by significant technological advancements, including the control of fire, the invention of stone tools, and the domestication of plants and animals. Archaeologists and anthropologists study this period through the analysis of physical artifacts and cultural remnants, such as fossils, tools, and architectural structures. Despite the absence of written records, the narrative of prehistory is pieced together from these material remains, providing invaluable insights into the evolution of human societies and their interactions with the environment. Understanding prehistory is not only crucial for tracing our origins but also for contextualizing the complexities of modern human cultures and behaviors.",14.6,25.8,16.3,15.9,16.67,15.84,6.57,11.833333333333334

Prehistory, the period preceding written records, encompasses the dawn of human existence until the advent of writing systems. It's a vast era, spanning from approximately 6 million years ago, when the first hominids appeared, to around 3200 BCE, when the Sumerians developed cuneiform script in Mesopotamia (Renfrew & Bahn, 2016). This era is typically divided into Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, each characterized by the dominant tool-making material. Prehistory is a crucial field of study for understanding our evolutionary journey, cultural development, and the emergence of complex societies. It's explored through archaeology, anthropology, and paleo sciences, which use material culture, fossils, and environmental data to reconstruct past lives and landscapes. While it lacks written records, prehistory is not silent; it speaks through the artifacts, architecture, and environmental remnants left behind by our ancestors.",11.5,44.75,14.7,14.0,14.09,14.5,5.96,10.666666666666666

The term 'prehistory' refers to the period before written records were created, extending from the emergence of the first humans until the advent of literacy. This era encompasses the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, each defined by the primary materials used for tool creation. During prehistory, human societies were primarily nomadic hunter-gatherers, later transitioning to more settled agricultural lifestyles. Archaeological artifacts and physical evidence, such as tools, pottery, and architectural remains, serve as the primary sources for understanding this time, as opposed to historical accounts. The study of prehistory, known as archaeology, aims to reconstruct human history and cultural evolution through these material remains.",11.7,38.72,13.6,14.0,14.45,14.61,5.85,7.375

""Prehistory, as a term, refers to the period preceding written records, which typically coincides with the Stone Age. It encompasses a vast expanse of time, ranging from the emergence of hominids around 6 million years ago to the invention of writing systems, approximately 3300 BCE. This epoch is characterized by significant technological advancements, such as the development of stone tools, fire control, and eventually, metalworking. However, our understanding of this era is primarily derived from archaeological and paleontological evidence, as direct written accounts are scarce. The study of prehistory is thus an interdisciplinary endeavor, drawing upon methods from fields like archaeology, anthropology, geology, and biology to piece together the narrative of human evolution and societal development.""",14.4,26.4,15.6,15.4,16.28,15.2,6.12,11.166666666666666

Prehistory, the period before written records, poses a challenge to historians, yet archaeologists have developed robust methods to reconstruct past human activities. This era spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing systems, which vary by culture and time period, typically falling between 3200 BCE in Mesopotamia and 1200 BCE in ancient China (Trigger, 2006). Archaeologists employ material culture—artifacts, architecture, and environmental data—to infer past behaviors and societal structures. Radiocarbon dating and other scientific techniques help establish chronologies, while ethnographic analogies and theoretical models aid in interpreting the data (Binford, 2001).

Prehistory, a period preceding written records, is often divided into Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, marked by technological advancements. These eras are not clearly delineated but rather overlapping phases reflecting regional variations in cultural evolution. The Stone Age, commencing with the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago, is further segmented into Lower, Middle, and Upper Paleolithic, distinguished by changes in stone tool technology. The advent of metallurgy characterized the Bronze and Iron Ages, which saw significant societal developments such as the rise of cities, complex social structures, and specialized crafts. Prehistoric cultures are studied through archaeology, which employs artifact analysis, site excavation, and environmental reconstruction to infer past human behavior and cultural dynamics. This approach allows us to trace human history back to our earliest ancestors, offering valuable insights into our species' evolution and the development of",12.5,36.79,15.0,14.9,15.96,15.54,6.21,7.875
