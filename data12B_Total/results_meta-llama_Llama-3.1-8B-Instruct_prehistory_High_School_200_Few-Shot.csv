Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

Prehistory is the vast, mysterious, and untold story of our ancestors who lived before the dawn of written records. It is a period of human history that spans from the emergence of the first hominids, who walked upright on two legs, to the advent of the first writing systems. This period stretches back millions of years and includes the lives of people who lived in caves, built shelters, hunted and gathered food, and developed simple tools. Many of these ancient people left behind artifacts, such as stone carvings, pottery, and tools, which have been discovered and studied by archaeologists. These artifacts provide a glimpse into the lives of our prehistoric ancestors and have helped us to piece together the story of how humans evolved and developed over time. By studying the artifacts and the remains of prehistoric people, we can learn about their cultures, their way of life, and the challenges they faced. The study of prehistory is a fascinating and ongoing journey of discovery that sheds light on",11.8,49.35,13.2,13.7,12.23,11.08,5.58,15.25

The study of prehistory is the analysis of the material remains of human cultures before the advent of written records. Archaeologists use the study of artifacts and other material evidence to reconstruct the lives of past societies. Prehistory is divided into several distinct periods, each marked by the development of new technologies and cultural practices. The earliest period, often called the Paleolithic era, dates back to the emergence of early humans in Africa. During this time, humans lived in small groups, hunting and gathering food in a nomadic lifestyle. The Neolithic era followed, characterized by the domestication of plants and animals, which led to the development of settled agriculture and more complex societies. As human societies grew and evolved, so too did the complexity of their technologies and cultures, laying the foundation for the civilizations of the past. Through the study of prehistory, archaeologists can gain a deeper understanding of the human experience and the development of modern societies.

Prehistory, the period before written records, is a subject that continues to fascinate scholars. The lack of written records has led to much debate and speculation about the lives of our ancient ancestors. Archaeologists have had to rely on the interpretation of artifacts and other evidence to piece together the lives of prehistoric peoples. The study of prehistory requires a great deal of patience and attention to detail, as the artifacts that have survived to the present day are often fragmentary and incomplete. Despite these challenges, scholars have been able to learn a great deal about prehistoric cultures through the analysis of tools, weapons, and other artifacts. The discovery of the earliest human remains, such as those found in Africa and Asia, has provided valuable insights into the evolution of our species. By studying prehistory, we can gain a greater understanding of the development of human society and the lives of our ancient ancestors.

You can setup your calculator to work either in natural display or linear display. Natural display causes fractions, irrational numbers, expressions, and certain functions to be displayed as you see them on paper. Linear display causes fractions and other expressions to be displayed in a line. 
When we come across an expression such as 7 + 3 ÷ 10 × 1, it makes a difference how we choose which operations to perform first.
Scientific calculators have been programmed to follow preset mathematical rules. If we press the buttons in a certain order, the calculator does the operations according to the rules that it has been programmed with.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (High School), limited to 200 words.  Prehistory is the period of human history that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of writing or the invention of metal tools, approximately 2.5 million years ago to 5,000 years ago. During prehistory, humans did not leave behind written records of their daily lives, but they did leave behind other evidence of their presence and activities, such as tools, artifacts, and archaeological sites. Prehistory can be divided into several distinct periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each characterized by significant technological, social, and cultural developments. Despite the lack of written records, prehistory is a rich and complex field of study, offering insights into the evolution of human societies, cultures, and technologies. Through the analysis of artifacts and other evidence, researchers can reconstruct the lives of ancient humans and gain a deeper understanding of the human past.

Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

This means that we do not have direct access to the thoughts, feelings, and experiences of prehistoric people. We can only learn about their lives by studying their material culture, such as tools, shelters, and other artifacts that they left behind. These artifacts provide valuable clues about the technology, social organization, and ways of life of prehistoric people. By analyzing these artifacts and the context in which they were found, archaeologists and anthropologists can reconstruct the lives of prehistoric people and gain a deeper understanding of their cultures.

Prehistory refers to the time before written records existed. During this period, humans lived on earth and developed tools, social structures, and cultures, but they left behind no written accounts of their lives. The prehistoric era was marked by the emergence of early civilizations, such as the ancient Sumerians, who built cities and created complex societies. In these early communities, people developed specialized roles, such as farmers, hunters, and craftsmen, and they began to trade goods with one another. The prehistoric period also saw the development of art, music, and literature, as well as the creation of some of the world's most impressive architectural achievements, such as the pyramids of Egypt and the temples of Mesopotamia. Despite the lack of written records, archaeologists have been able to reconstruct the lives of prehistoric people through their discovery of artifacts, such as tools, pottery, and other relics, which provide valuable insights into the cultures and ways of life of our ancient ancestors.",12.0,48.74,14.2,14.2,13.15,12.13,5.73,15.25

Prehistory is the time before written records. It is a vast period of time that spans millions of years, from the emergence of the first life on earth to the beginning of civilization. Our knowledge of prehistory is based on archaeological evidence, such as fossils, artifacts, and rock paintings. By studying these remains, we can gain insights into the lives and cultures of ancient people. Fossils, for example, reveal information about the evolution of life on earth, while artifacts provide clues about the tools and technology used by early humans. Rock paintings, on the other hand, offer a glimpse into the art and spirituality of ancient societies. The study of prehistory is essential for understanding the development of human societies and the evolution of culture. It is a field that continues to fascinate and inform us about our shared human past. By examining the remnants of prehistoric cultures, we can piece together the narrative of our collective history.
