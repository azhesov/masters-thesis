Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 150 words. Prehistory is the study of the human past from the earliest known times to the invention of writing, a period often referred to as the Stone Age. Prehistory is studied by archaeologists and historians, who use evidence such as artifacts, structures, and human remains to reconstruct past societies. Unlike historical periods, which are documented through written records, prehistory is inferred through material culture and environmental data. The study of prehistory allows us to understand the origins and evolution of human cultures, technologies, and social structures, as well as the impact of humans on the environment.

Prehistory (from the Greek 'pro', meaning 'before', and 'histor', meaning 'history'), is the scholarly and scientific study of the human past from the earliest known times to the advent of written records, a period often referred to as the Stone Age.

Prehistory refers to the period of human history that lacks written records.

Prehistory, from the Greek 'pro', meaning 'before', and 'historia', meaning 'history', is the period before written records, when understanding human life and culture relies heavily on archaeology. Archaeologists, like astronomers in cosmology, piece together evidence from artifacts, architecture, and environmental data to reconstruct past societies.

Prehistory, or archæology, is the study of human history and prehistory. Prehistory is the study of human history from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. Archaeologists study the physical remains of human activity, including artifacts, architecture, and human remains, to understand how people lived and interacted with their environment in the past. Prehistory can be further divided into several periods based on cultural developments, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Unlike history, which is based on written records, prehistory relies on the interpretation of material culture to reconstruct the past.",15.3,34.8,17.9,16.8,17.22,13.35,6.96,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 150 words. Prehistory refers to the period of human history before the invention of written records.

Prehistory, from the Greek words ""pro"", meaning ""before"", and ""historia"", meaning ""history"", is the study of human existence before the advent of writing. This era spans from the first emergence of hominids, the human-like species that preceded modern humans, to the advent of writing systems, a period of several million years. Archaeologists, anthropologists, and other scholars study prehistoric cultures through the analysis of physical remains, such as tools, structures, and art, as well as genetic evidence. Despite the absence of written records, these remains offer invaluable insights into the lives, beliefs, and technological advancements of our ancient ancestors, painting a vivid picture of human life before history as we know it began.",15.9,33.17,18.8,16.6,17.45,13.7,7.17,18.0

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 150 words. Prehistory refers to the period before written records, typically before the invention of writing systems or before the invention of writing systems in a particular region.

Prehistory (from the Greek 'protos', meaning 'before', and 'historia', meaning 'history') is the study of human life and cultures before the advent of written records. This period spans from the emergence of the earliest humans around 2.6 million years ago until the invention of writing systems, which varies by region. Archaeologists and anthropologists, along with historians and philosophers, explore this time through material remains like artifacts, architecture, and art, as well as through genetic evidence and environmental data. Theories in prehistory can include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, as assumptions often cannot be directly tested due to the lack of written records.",15.3,34.8,18.3,16.5,16.95,13.76,6.96,18.0
