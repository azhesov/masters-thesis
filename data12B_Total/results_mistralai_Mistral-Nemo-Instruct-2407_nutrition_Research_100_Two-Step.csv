Write a summary about 'nutrition'. Limit the output to 100 words. ""Nutrition is the process of providing or obtaining food, and utilizing it by the body for growth, maintenance, and repair. It involves consuming a balanced diet, comprising macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals), and water, to meet the body's energy and nutrient needs. Adequate nutrition promotes health, prevents diseases like obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disorders, and supports mental well-being. Conversely, poor nutrition can lead to deficiencies, stunted growth, and various health issues.""","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Research and limit the output to 100 words:
