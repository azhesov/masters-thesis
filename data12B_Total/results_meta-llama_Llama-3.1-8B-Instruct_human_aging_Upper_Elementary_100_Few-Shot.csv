As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

As humans age, their bodies undergo many changes. They lose muscle mass, and their joints become stiff and aching. Their skin wrinkles and loses its elasticity, much like the bark of a tree that has grown old and weathered. Their hair turns gray, and their eyesight may begin to fail. But even as their bodies change, their minds can remain sharp and active. Many elderly people continue to learn and grow, much like a garden that continues to bloom long after the first flowers have faded. Their wisdom and experience make them valuable members of society. Example:

The sun rose high over the fields, where the young men and women were hard at work reaping the golden wheat. The air was filled with the sweet scent of blooming wildflowers, and the sound",7.5,71.34,9.1,9.9,9.18,8.7,4.5,7.142857142857142

The human body is a machine. It can run fast and work hard, but it needs to slow down and rest. This is called aging. Aging happens to everyone. It happens because our bodies are made of tiny parts, like tiny engines. Over time, these tiny engines start to wear down. This is why people may not be able to run as fast or do as many things as they used to. Aging is a normal part of life. It helps us understand that we are not invincible and that we need to take care of our bodies.  (Note: readability level of 6.8)  (Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level)

As people age, they don't want to just go through the motions. They want to understand why things change, and how they can make the most of their time. By asking questions, people can stand out. For example, some elderly individuals like to volunteer, attending meetings and learning about the projects. Others like to work with teams, sharing their experiences and knowledge. As they grow older, people often become leaders, and others rely on them for answers. With time, they figure out how to make the most of their lives.

Example 3:
Human aging is a natural process. Our bodies grow and develop until we reach adulthood, at which point our growth slows down. As we get older, our bodies start to wear down. Our skin wrinkles, our muscles weaken, and our bones lose density. Eventually, our bodies are no longer able to do everything they used to do. We may experience age-related illnesses, such as cataracts or arthritis. But it's not all bad news! As we age, we also become wiser and more experienced. We can pass on our knowledge to others and help them grow. Aging is a part of life. Example 4:
As children, we are full of energy and curiosity. Our minds are constantly growing and developing, and our bodies are learning new things every day. But as we get older, our growth slows down. Our skin starts to wrinkle, and our muscles become weaker. We may experience age-related illnesses, such as cataracts or arthritis.",6.4,74.29,7.3,9.5,8.05,7.82,4.06,7.142857142857142

""Human aging"" is a term that refers to the changes that occur in the body as people get older. One of the main signs of human aging is wrinkles, which occur when skin loses its elasticity. Another sign is gray hair, which happens when the pigment in hair fades. As people age, their bodies become weaker and less flexible. Eventually, people may need assistance with daily tasks, like eating and walking. These changes are a natural part of life, and they happen to everyone who lives long enough. They are not diseases.

Here is a paragraph about human aging written in a similar style to the examples:

As people grow older, their bodies begin to change. They start to notice their hair turning gray and their muscles weakening. By asking questions and seeking answers, scientists are learning more about the aging process. They go to meetings to discuss their findings and work together with other experts to understand why people age. One of the scientists discovered that the cells in our bodies become less efficient as we age. This is why older people often need more rest. With more research, scientists hope to find ways to slow down the aging process and keep people healthy for longer.  ​

However, I want to make it more exciting, more like a story. Here's a paragraph about human aging that's a bit more engaging:

As Dr. Thompson studied the human body, she discovered that it was like a machine that ran on batteries. As people grew older, their batteries started to run down. They began to notice their hair turning",7.0,72.56,8.3,9.6,8.3,8.47,4.17,7.142857142857142

Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

As children grew, their bodies began to change. Some had a strong build, while others were slender. Their energy levels fluctuated, and they required more sleep. Hair would fall, and skin began to wrinkle. Teeth would start to lose their sparkle, and vision became less clear. These changes were a sign of aging. It was as if the body was shedding its youth, like leaves on a tree fall to the ground. As people aged, they gained wisdom and knowledge, but their physical appearance changed. They were still the same person, but their body was evolving, like a tree that continues to grow.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 100 words.  Human bodies change as people get older. As humans grow from babies to teenagers, they grow taller and stronger. But as people get older, their bodies change in different ways. Their bones might become thinner and more brittle, making them more likely to break. Their muscles might get smaller and weaker, making it harder to move around. But some people stay active and healthy for a long time, and take care of their bodies by eating well and exercising regularly. This helps them stay healthy and strong as they get older. This is the best way to live a long and healthy life. 

Here is a rewritten paragraph using vocabulary and structure from examples, targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 100 words:

Example:
As people get older, they may begin to lose their hearing. Their sense of smell may also fade away. But their eyesight might become sharper. And some older people's hair turns gray. When children grow, they get taller and their bones get stronger. As people grow old, their bones get weaker. This is a natural part of getting older. Some older people's muscles may get a bit smaller. Their skin may become thinner and less flexible. But it's okay. Everyone gets older and their bodies change. And even if their bodies change, they can still be happy and healthy. Example is 100 words. 

However, I'm interested in writing a short paragraph about human aging, focusing on the brain. Here's a short paragraph.

As people grow older, they begin to notice many physical changes in their bodies. Their skin becomes wrinkled, their hair turns gray, and their energy levels decrease. Some people may experience age-related health issues, like arthritis or cataracts. It's essential to take care of ourselves, especially as we get older. Eating a balanced diet, exercising regularly, and getting enough sleep can help us stay healthy. By doing these things, we can slow down the aging process and maintain our independence as we get older. This allows us to live a happy, healthy life.
