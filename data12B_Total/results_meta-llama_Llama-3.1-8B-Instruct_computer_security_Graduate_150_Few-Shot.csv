Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Computer security, or infosec, is the field of study, research, and application focused on protecting information by preventing, detecting, and responding to unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It is a branch of information technology that has evolved significantly over the years due to advancements in technology and the growing need for secure data transmission and storage. Computer security threats, such as malware, phishing, and data breaches, pose a significant risk to individuals, businesses, and governments. A secure computer system is designed to prevent unauthorized access, ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data, and provide mechanisms for detection, prevention, and response to security incidents. The field of computer security is constantly evolving, with new threats and technologies emerging, and it requires ongoing research and innovation to stay ahead of these threats and maintain a secure digital environment.

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Computer security, or IT security, is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, and protection of computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It is the study of the scientific laws that govern the vulnerabilities and threats to these systems, as well as the countermeasures that can be taken to prevent these threats. The term computer security was first used in 1964 by the U.S. Department of Defense in their publication, Trusted Computer System Evaluation Criteria. The field of computer security is a rapidly evolving body of knowledge, and it is studied by experts in computer science, mathematics, and engineering, as well as by policymakers and other stakeholders. As a result, the theories and countermeasures in computer security often include both technical and non-technical propositions. 
The protection of computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction is the principal objective of computer security. Various methods, such as",14.9,35.91,17.8,17.1,16.45,13.93,6.7,18.0
