Prehistory, the period preceding written records, spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the advent of writing, approximately 300,000 years ago to 4,000 BCE. It encompasses various cultures and societies, each with distinct characteristics, such as Neanderthals, Cro-Magnon, and ancient Mesopotamians. Archaeological findings and fossil records are the primary sources for reconstructing this era.

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. (Hint: You may want to define 'prehistory' and provide some examples of how it is studied.)

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the College level.
To explain 'prehistory' to a College-level reader, I would need to define it in a way that acknowledges its broad scope and the methods used to study it. This means discussing how prehistory encompasses the period before written records, highlighting the reliance on archaeological and anthropological research, and perhaps mentioning key discoveries or methodologies.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
Using appropriate vocabulary involves selecting terms that are precise yet accessible to a College-level audience. This might include using terms like ""archaeological sites,"" ""prehistoric cultures,"" and ""anthropological studies."" Sentence structure should be clear and concise, potentially using complex sentences to convey the breadth of the subject.

The final answer is: 
Prehistory refers to the period of time before written records existed, typically before the development of alphabetic writing. During this time, human societies were organized into tribal and kinship groups, with cultures that were shaped by geography and available resources. Archaeologists study the artifacts and remains of these societies to reconstruct the past. 
Note: The length of the paragraph is 49 words, so it is slightly under the 50-word limit. However, it still meets the requirements of the assignment.  To meet the 50-word limit, a few words could be added to the paragraph, such as ""This period"" before ""refers to"" to",9.5,55.24,10.6,11.5,10.36,10.96,4.71,7.7142857142857135

Step 4: Check your paragraph against your original goal and revise if necessary.
I have written the first paragraph, which is as follows:
Prehistory, the period before written records, is a term used by historians to describe the times when humans lived without a written language. During this period, early humans developed various tools and techniques that would aid in the development of civilizations. The period is often divided into different epochs based on archaeological discoveries and technological advancements.

My original goal was to explain the term ""prehistory"" in 50 words, but my paragraph exceeds that limit. I will revise the paragraph to fit within the 50-word limit while keeping the same content. Here is the revised paragraph:

Prehistory, the period before written records, is used by historians to describe times when humans lived without a written language. Early humans developed tools and techniques that aided the development of civilizations. Epochs are divided based on archaeological discoveries and technological advancements.

Here is a sample response in 50 words.
Prehistory spans time before written records. The period is divided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras, each marked by significant technological advancements. Humans transitioned from hunter-gatherer societies to more complex, agricultural communities, laying the groundwork for civilizations and the emergence of written languages. New cultures developed. 

Reasoning skill for Consequence Evaluation: This task requires the ability to evaluate the consequences of the development of writing and its impact on human societies. The paragraph implies that the emergence of written languages was a significant consequence of prehistoric developments, enabling the creation of civilizations and new cultures. This skill is essential for Consequence Evaluation, as it involves analyzing the outcomes of historical events and their effects on subsequent developments.

The prehistoric era is the period of time before written records were kept. It began millions of years ago and continued until the rise of civilizations with written languages, approximately 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. 
The era is characterized by the presence of early humans, including Homo sapiens, and the evolution of various cultures, languages, and technologies.

Step 5: Edit the paragraph for clarity and accuracy.
The prehistoric era spans millions of years and ends with the rise of civilizations that employed written languages, roughly 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. Early humans, such as Homo sapiens, lived during this time, and diverse cultures, languages, and technologies emerged and evolved.
