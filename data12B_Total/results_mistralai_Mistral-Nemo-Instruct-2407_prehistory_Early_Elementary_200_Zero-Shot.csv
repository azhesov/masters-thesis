Once upon a time, before people started writing things down, there was a time called prehistory. During this time, people didn't have computers, cars, or even books. They lived in different ways, some as hunters and gatherers, some as farmers. They made tools from stones and wood. They told stories and passed down knowledge through pictures and sounds. This time lasted for thousands of years, from when early humans first appeared until people started writing history down. It's like a big puzzle, and scientists are still trying to put all the pieces together to understand what life was like then.",7.2,66.74,9.6,10.0,8.28,10.95,4.22,5.666666666666667

Prehistory is the time before written history began. This means we don't have books or records from that time. People in prehistory were hunters, gatherers, and farmers. They used tools made from bones, stones, and wood. They didn't have cars or computers, but they had their own ways of living and learning. Prehistoric people lived in many places around the world. Some lived in caves, while others built homes from mud or wood. They didn't write stories, but they made art on walls and created beautiful jewelry. This art helps us understand their lives and how they saw the world. Prehistory ended around 5,000 years ago when people started writing things down.",6.3,68.97,8.1,9.7,7.73,10.07,3.62,5.1

Prehistory is the time before written history, when humans didn't write down their stories. It started about 3 million years ago when the first humans appeared.

They didn't have schools or books, so they passed down knowledge through stories and drawings on cave walls. This is the time when our earliest ancestors learned to make fire and build shelters.

Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down. It's like when there were no books, no newspapers, and no computers. People used to live in different ways than we do now. They might live in caves or make their own homes from wood and leaves. They didn't have cars or planes, so they walked or used animals to travel. They learned how to make tools from stones and bones.
