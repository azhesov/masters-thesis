Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

Prehistory is the period before recorded history, and it typically covers the time when humans' early ancestors, such as Homo habilis, Homo erectus, and Neanderthals, were prevalent on Earth. Prehistory is often studied through archaeological methods, which involve the examination of artifacts, fossils, and other physical remains.

Prehistory, a vast realm preceding written records, is a stage where humanity's ancestors, like Homo habilis and Neanderthals, thrived. It's a period shrouded in mystery, yet unraveled through archaeology's meticulous examination of artifacts and fossils. These remnants, akin to the remnants of a moth in a relay, offer invaluable insights into our lineage, providing glimpses of their tools, culture, and daily lives. It's a captivating narrative, pieced together painstakingly, much like the process of debugging a complex system, revealing the intricate evolution of our species.",15.1,35.31,18.4,17.1,17.55,14.1,7.33,19.25

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

Prehistory, a vast expanse of time before written records, is a realm of mystery and intrigue, teeming with echoes of ancient civilizations. It spans from the dawn of Homo sapiens to the advent of writing, an era marked by oral histories, artifacts, and architectural marvels. Archaeologists, the detectives of this era, employ an array of tools and methods - from carbon dating to linguistic analysis - to unravel the enigmatic tales of our ancestors.",15.5,34.39,18.0,16.8,17.79,13.18,7.45,19.25

Prehistory, a vast expanse of time before written records, is a realm of fascination for historians. It encompasses the Stone Age, when humans first harnessed fire, and the Bronze Age, when metallurgy emerged. Archaeological artifacts, such as tools and pottery, serve as our ""texts,"" offering glimpses into the lives of our ancestors. Yet, unlike books, they do not convey language or narratives directly, making prehistory's interpretation a complex, ongoing endeavor.",14.6,36.73,17.3,16.5,17.23,13.7,7.11,19.25

The study of prehistory is the process of understanding life in the past, before the invention of writing. Prehistory involves numerous aspects, including archaeology, anthropology, geology, and biology. These fields help scientists to uncover the habits and cultures of early humans. Prehistoric life was often characterized by nomadic lifestyles, tool use, and complex social structures. While direct evidence is limited, scientists use indirect clues like fossils, artifacts, and environmental data to piece together this intriguing era.",14.5,36.93,17.5,16.9,17.19,14.05,7.12,19.25
