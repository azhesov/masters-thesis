Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 200 words. Good nutrition helps your body grow strong and healthy. It gives you the energy to play and learn. Eating fruits, vegetables, and whole grains provides your body with the nutrients it needs. These foods are packed with vitamins and minerals that keep you healthy. Drinking plenty of water also helps your body function properly. Avoid eating too many sugary or salty foods.

Nutrition is about what we eat and drink to stay healthy. It's not just about getting big or strong, but also about feeling good and having enough energy to do all the things we love.

Nutrition is like the fuel that keeps our bodies running. When we eat healthy foods, our bodies get the nutrients they need to grow strong and stay healthy. Just like a car needs good gas to drive smoothly, our bodies need good food to work well. Eating a balanced diet, with plenty of fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins, can help us feel more energetic and focused. It can also boost our immune system, making us less likely to get sick.

Did you know that our bodies need nutrients to grow and stay healthy? You might be wondering, ""What are nutrients?"" Great question! Nutrients are like the building blocks our bodies use to function properly. They come from the food we eat. There are six main nutrients our bodies need: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. Each of these nutrients has a special job to do in our bodies. For example, carbohydrates give us energy to play and learn, while proteins help our bodies grow and repair themselves. So, by eating a variety of foods that contain these nutrients, we're helping our bodies stay strong and healthy.",7.0,72.66,8.5,10.1,8.78,8.64,4.2,7.142857142857142

Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went.

Nutrition is like fuel for our bodies. It's not just about eating, but knowing what and how much to eat. Like Johnson asking ""hows"" and ""whys,"" we should ask what foods give us energy and help us grow. Some foods are like the ""why nots"" — they don't give us much good, like too much candy. We need a mix, like Ruth gathering grain from Boaz's fields, taking what we need and leaving the rest.",6.0,80.72,8.0,9.3,8.61,7.71,4.14,7.142857142857142
