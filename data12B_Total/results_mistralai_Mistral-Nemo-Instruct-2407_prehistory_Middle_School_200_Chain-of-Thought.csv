Prehistory is a long time ago, before people started writing things down. This period is before history, which is when people started recording events. During prehistory, humans and their ancestors were nomads, moving from place to place. They hunted and gathered food for survival. Over time, they learned to farm and make tools from stone, wood, and other materials. Prehistoric people also created art, like paintings on cave walls. Many of these artworks are still around today, showing us a glimpse into their lives.",6.6,68.26,9.1,9.3,7.75,10.88,4.02,5.666666666666667

**Prehistory Explained for Middle School Students**

Prehistory is like a big storybook that tells us about the time before people started writing things down. It's like when you were a little kid and you told your friends stories about dinosaurs, but no one could prove if they were real or not. That's similar to prehistory because we don't have any books or letters from that time. Instead, we use clues like rocks, bones, and pictures drawn on cave walls to figure out what happened.

Think of it like a big mystery. Scientists are the detectives who study these clues to learn about the past. They look at how people lived, what they ate, and how they made things. It's like putting together a puzzle, but the pieces are millions of years old!",6.4,74.08,8.3,9.2,8.27,8.92,4.05,6.625

The time before people started writing down their history is called prehistory. This was a very long time ago, before paper, pencils, and computers were invented. So, we don't have any books or letters from people who lived during this time. However, scientists have found many other clues to help us learn about life in prehistoric times. These clues include fossils, paintings on cave walls, and even the tools that people made out of stone or bone.

Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down. This period starts with the first humans and ends when the first civilizations emerged. It's like a giant puzzle, and we're trying to piece it together with clues from ancient rocks, fossils, and artifacts. Archaeologists, who study these clues, divide prehistory into three main periods: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. In the Stone Age, people made tools from stones and bones. In the Bronze Age, they learned to make metal tools. Finally, in the Iron Age, they started using iron tools. These ages help us understand how humans lived and changed over thousands of years before writing was invented.",6.0,75.2,8.7,9.3,7.76,9.73,3.77,6.625

Prehistory is like a huge jigsaw puzzle that scientists are still trying to put together. It covers all the time before people started writing things down, so it's a time without history books. Instead, scientists look for clues in the things people made, the places they lived, and the ways they lived. This can include tools, art, and even bones from animals they hunted or ate. These clues help us understand how people lived and changed over thousands of years.",6.7,73.27,9.2,9.8,8.31,9.62,4.16,7.428571428571429
