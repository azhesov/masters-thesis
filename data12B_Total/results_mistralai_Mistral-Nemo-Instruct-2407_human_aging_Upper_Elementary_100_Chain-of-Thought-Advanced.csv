- Mention that these changes are normal and happen to everyone.

**Final Paragraph:**

""Human aging is the process of growing older, happening naturally over time. Key factors are: cells dividing less, leading to tissue damage; waste buildup in cells; and DNA damage. These cause physical changes like slower healing, weaker bones, and wrinkles. Mentally, we may see slower thinking and memory loss. These changes are normal and affect everyone.""",7.2,61.22,8.9,8.8,6.76,10.24,4.39,4.8

Human aging is when our body and mind gradually change over time. This process starts from the moment we are born. As we grow older, our cells divide more slowly, and we become more prone to diseases. Our skin wrinkles, hair turns gray, and bones become fragile. Our memory might not be as sharp, and we might not move as quickly as before. This happens because our body's systems don't work as well as they used to. However, each person ages differently, and some people might age more quickly than others due to their lifestyle or health conditions.",5.6,76.32,7.8,8.2,6.77,8.86,4.06,5.444444444444445

**Output:**

Human aging is a natural process where our bodies gradually change over time. As we get older, our cells divide more slowly, and we start to lose muscle and bone. Our senses, like hearing and vision, might weaken. We may also have more health problems.

Step 4: Follow your plan and write the final paragraph. Here's how I plan to do it:

Human aging is when our bodies change over time. Cells that usually fix damage stop working as well, leading to wrinkles, grey hair, and weaker bones. Our organs also age, like the heart pumping less blood or the lungs taking in less air. This makes us slower, less energetic, and more prone to diseases. It's a natural process, happening to everyone, but it happens faster in some people than others.

Now, let's calculate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of the paragraph:

- Total words: 66
- Total sentences: 2
- Total syllables: 269 (counted manually)

Using the formula:
0.39 × (66 / 2) + 11.8 × (269 / 66) - 15.59 = 6.02

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of the paragraph is approximately",6.6,68.16,8.5,9.4,7.22,8.97,4.19,5.444444444444445

**Output:**
Human aging is a natural process where our bodies and minds gradually change over time. This starts in our twenties when cells begin to divide slower, making us more prone to illnesses. Our skin wrinkles, hair turns gray, and bones weaken. Memory may fade, and reactions slow down. This happens due to wear and tear on cells, damage from harmful molecules called free radicals, and changes in our genes.",6.7,67.96,8.6,9.5,8.38,9.85,4.41,5.666666666666667
