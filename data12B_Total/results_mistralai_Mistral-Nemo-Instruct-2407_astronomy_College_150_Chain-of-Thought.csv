Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere, is a multifaceted field that combines principles of physics, mathematics, and chemistry. At its core, astronomy seeks to understand the universe's structure, composition, and evolution. It explores a vast array of celestial bodies, from stars and planets to galaxies and black holes, each providing unique insights into the cosmos. For instance, studying the Sun's nuclear fusion process helps us understand stellar evolution, while examining the redshift of light from distant galaxies reveals the universe's accelerating expansion. Modern astronomy employs advanced technologies such as space telescopes, radio observatories, and gravitational wave detectors, pushing the boundaries of our knowledge and fueling our fascination with the cosmos.",11.9,38.42,14.8,14.2,13.9,15.77,6.13,7.111111111111111

Astronomy, derived from the Greek words 'astron' (star) and 'nomos' (law), is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere. It encompasses the physical and chemical properties of stars, planets, galaxies, and other celestial bodies, as well as the laws and processes that govern their interactions. Astronomy is a vast and interdisciplinary field, drawing upon principles from physics, mathematics, chemistry, and even biology. By employing advanced technologies like telescopes and space probes, astronomers observe the universe, collect data, and formulate theories to explain and predict its behavior. This endeavor not only expands our understanding of the cosmos but also contributes to technological advancements and stimulates philosophical contemplation about our place in the universe.",12.0,38.11,14.3,13.9,14.35,15.08,5.87,7.625
