Paragraph:
""Prehistory is like the very early chapters of a book, before people could write down their stories. It's the time before history, when our ancestors were hunters and gatherers, living off the land. First, they were nomads, moving from place to place in search of food and shelter. Then, they started to settle down, building homes, and farming the land. This was a big change, and it's called the Neolithic Revolution. Prehistory covers a long time, from the first humans about 2.5 million years ago until the invention of writing, around 3400 BC. It's like a fascinating puzzle, with each piece telling us more about how our ancestors lived and evolved.""",6.9,67.35,8.4,9.6,8.4,9.5,3.97,5.888888888888889

Sure, let's try to break this down into simpler steps:

1. **Explain 'prehistory' in simple terms**: Prehistory is the time before we had written records. This means there were no books, newspapers, or even calendars to tell us what happened. People lived, but their stories weren't written down.

2. **Choose appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure**: Use simple, familiar words. Short sentences can help keep the information easy to understand.

3. **Write the paragraph**: Prehistory is a long time ago, before people could write. They didn't have books or calendars. So, we don't have stories or dates from that time. Only archaeologists can find out about it by digging up old things.

4. **Review and revise**: Let's make sure the paragraph is clear and easy to understand.

Here's a revised version:

Before there were written records, people lived on Earth. This time is called prehistory, which means ""before history."" Imagine a time when humans didn't use computers or cars. Instead, they relied on nature for everything they needed. They hunted animals for food, made tools from stones and bones, and built shelters from materials they found around them. Prehistory lasted for thousands of years, until people began to write down their stories and create art that we can still see today. During this time, humans spread across the globe, adapting to different climates and environments.",7.0,67.25,9.1,9.1,7.34,10.54,4.1,5.555555555555555

Long ago, before anyone had invented writing, humans lived on Earth. This time period is called prehistory, which means 'before history.' We don't have any written records from this time, so archaeologists, scientists who study human history, look for clues like tools, art, and buildings made by early humans. These clues help us understand how people lived thousands of years ago, without any books or computers. Even though we can't read about it, prehistory is a fascinating part of our past!",7.5,65.93,9.3,10.3,8.75,10.14,4.03,6.625

**Prehistory** is the time before people started writing things down. This period starts around 3.3 million years ago and ends about 5,000 years ago. During prehistory, humans were hunter-gatherers. This means they moved around a lot, following animals to hunt and gathering plants to eat. They didn't live in one place all the time. Instead, they traveled in small groups called tribes. These early humans made tools from stone, bone, and wood. They also created art, like paintings on cave walls. Archaeologists study prehistory by examining these tools and art, as well as the bones of animals and plants. This helps us understand how early humans lived and interacted with their environment.",6.2,69.18,8.4,9.6,7.51,10.54,3.42,5.1

Prehistory is the time before history, which means before people started writing things down. It's like a big, long period of time that includes the lives of all the animals and plants that came before us. Imagine if you could go back to when dinosaurs roamed the Earth or when early humans were just learning how to make tools. That's what prehistory is like! People who study this time period use clues from fossils, artifacts, and even how the land looks now to figure out what happened. It's almost like putting together a big puzzle without all the pieces!",6.6,73.68,8.2,9.3,7.56,8.81,3.9,6.375
