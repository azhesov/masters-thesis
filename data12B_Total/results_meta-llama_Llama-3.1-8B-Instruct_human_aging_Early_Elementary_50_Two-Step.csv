Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 50 words. 
Human aging is a complex process influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. It involves a decline in physical and cognitive functions, leading to increased susceptibility to diseases and mortality. Aging is characterized by telomere shortening, epigenetic changes, and cellular senescence, ultimately affecting overall health and quality of life. 
How does the article discuss the 'complexity of human aging'?
The article briefly describes the complexity of human aging by mentioning that it is influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. This suggests that aging is a multifaceted process that cannot be attributed to a single cause, and that various factors interact to shape the aging process.
What are the 'characteristics of human aging' mentioned in the article?

The article mentions the following characteristics of human aging:
1. Telomere shortening: Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes. As we age, telomeres shorten, which can lead to cellular aging and increased risk of diseases.
2. Epigenetic changes: Epigenetic changes refer to changes in gene expression that do not involve changes to the DNA sequence itself. These changes can affect how genes are turned on or off, and can contribute to the aging process.
3. Cellular senescence: Cellular senescence is a state in which cells stop dividing and enter a dormant state. This can occur due to various factors, including telomere shortening and epigenetic changes. Senescent cells can accumulate in tissues and contribute to aging and age-related diseases.
The article describes these characteristics as 'characteristics of human aging' and mentions that they ultimately affect overall health and quality of life.
