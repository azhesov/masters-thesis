Nutrition, the study of food and its impact on the body, centers on understanding nutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. These fuel our bodies, enabling growth, tissue maintenance, and repair. A balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, is essential for optimal health. Conversely, excessive consumption and poor food choices can result in obesity and related diseases. Regular exercise complements a healthy diet, promoting overall well-being.",9.9,49.01,12.9,13.1,11.08,14.2,5.13,8.428571428571429
