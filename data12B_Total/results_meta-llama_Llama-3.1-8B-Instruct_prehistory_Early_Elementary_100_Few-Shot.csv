The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 100 words. 

In prehistory, humans lived a long time ago. They did not have cars, houses, or computers. But they made their own tools. They used rocks and sticks. They hunted for food. They gathered fruits and berries. They made fire to cook their food. They lived in caves. Sometimes they had families. They worked together to survive. They did not write books, but they left clues. They made pictures on rocks. They made tools that are still found today. We can learn about their lives by looking at these clues. We can imagine how they lived. 
Note: There are many ways to write this paragraph, but I tried to mimic the style and structure of the examples.  The first sentence is similar to the first sentence of Example 1. The second sentence of Example 1 is ""They walk in their village."" In the paragraph, the equivalent sentence is ""They did not have cars, houses, or computers.""

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 100 words. 

Prehistory is when humans did not write. But they did make things. They made tools from stones. They made huts from branches. They made fires to cook food. People also made pictures on cave walls. The pictures showed animals and people. A long time ago, humans lived in small groups. They hunted animals to eat. They gathered fruits and plants to eat. They made clothes from animal hides. Humans made many things before they wrote. But we don’t know much about them because they did not write it down. We learn about them by finding their things. And by looking at the pictures on the cave walls. 

Note: The provided examples (Cat and Dog, Sun and Earth) were used as a reference to identify the required readability level and structure, which was then applied to the new topic 'prehistory'. The vocabulary and sentence structure were adjusted accordingly to match the identified readability level.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 100 words. 

Long, long ago, in prehistory, people didn’t know how to write. They used pictures and symbols to tell stories. They painted on rocks, trees, and caves. Some of these pictures show animals, like mammoths and saber-toothed tigers. They might also show people hunting or making tools. These pictures help us learn about prehistory. We can see what life was like a long time ago. Some people think these pictures were also used to tell stories about the people who made them. Maybe they even showed what they believed in. We can’t ask them, but their pictures still tell us a lot.  (100 words) 

The paragraph uses the following techniques from the examples:

* The use of imaginative language (‘long, long ago’) to engage the reader
* The use of basic sentence structures and vocabulary to facilitate reading comprehension
* The use of descriptive language to paint a picture in the reader’s mind (‘They painted on rocks, trees",2.0,96.48,3.2,6.7,4.78,4.49,2.76,2.1875

Prehistory is a long time ago. People did not write things down like we do. They made pictures on rocks and walls. They also made tools from sticks and stones. These tools helped them hunt and gather food. The people were nomads. They moved from place to place to find food. They were very good at making clothes and shelter. They made fire by rubbing sticks together. They used the fire to keep warm and cook their food. The people were very resourceful and clever. They made a good life for themselves. They did not need a lot of things.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 100 words. Here is the key vocabulary: prehistory, archaeologists, ancient, fossils, discoveries, artifacts.

Prehistory is a very long time ago. Long before your parents were born, or their parents, or even their parents’ parents. It was a time when humans lived in caves and hunted animals for food. Archaeologists are special people who study this time. They find fossils and other things from ancient times. These are called artifacts. Some archaeologists dig in the ground and find old tools and bones. Others look at old pictures and writings. These discoveries help us learn about the people who lived a long time ago. It's a very cool way to learn about the past!​ ​

Prehistory was a very long time ago. It was before we had any books or pictures. People didn’t know how to write yet. They used pictures on the walls to tell stories. The pictures showed animals and people. They showed what people did a long time ago. It was before cars, houses, and cities. People walked or used animals to get around. The earth was different too. It was cooler and had more ice. We can’t write a history of that time yet. We can only use the pictures that are left behind. These pictures are called fossils. They help us know what happened a long time ago.  ​

Before humans, animals, and plants lived on Earth. This time is called prehistory. Prehistory began millions and millions of years ago. Then, a long, long time ago, humans lived. But humans did not write. They did not leave many things to tell us what they did. The things they left behind are called fossils. These are bones and footprints. They tell us what the people and animals looked like. Fossils are important because they help us learn about prehistory. We can imagine what life was like before humans. We can see the animals and plants that lived. We can learn about the past.  We can see what came before us.  We can see what was before the people who came before us.  We can see it.  We can see it.
