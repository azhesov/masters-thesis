Computer security, also known as information security, is the practice of protecting computers, networks, and sensitive data from digital threats, damage, or unauthorized access. It involves implementing measures to secure these systems from cyber attacks, such as viruses, malware, and hackers. These measures include using strong passwords, installing security software, keeping systems up-to-date with the latest software patches, and being cautious of phishing emails. Additionally, computer security also involves creating backup plans to recover data in case of a breach, and educating users on best practices to maintain a secure environment.",11.3,39.94,13.2,12.0,10.85,14.03,5.85,6.111111111111111
