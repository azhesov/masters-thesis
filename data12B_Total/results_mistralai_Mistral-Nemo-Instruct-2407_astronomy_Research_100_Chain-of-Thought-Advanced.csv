Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects, is an ancient discipline that has evolved significantly over time. It involves observing, analyzing, and interpreting data about stars, planets, galaxies, and other celestial bodies using telescopes, space probes, and theoretical models. Astronomy seeks to understand the physical properties, origins, and evolution of celestial objects, as well as their interactions and relationships within the universe. It encompasses a wide range of sub-fields, including planetary science, solar physics, stellar astrophysics, and cosmology, each focusing on different aspects of the cosmos.
