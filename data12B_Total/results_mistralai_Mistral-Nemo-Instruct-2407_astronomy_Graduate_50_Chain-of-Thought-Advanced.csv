Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It uses physics and mathematics to explain their origins and evolution. Astronomers observe and analyze stars, planets, galaxies, and other celestial bodies to understand the universe's vastness and complexity. They also investigate phenomena like black holes, supernovae, and cosmic microwave background radiation. Modern astronomy includes both observational and theoretical methods, using powerful telescopes and advanced technology to explore the cosmos.",10.4,42.17,12.9,12.5,11.72,14.89,5.49,6.333333333333333
