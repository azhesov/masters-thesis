We need food to supply our bodies with carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. These nutrients are broken down into simple forms and absorbed into our bloodstream. Our body uses these nutrients to create energy, fix damaged tissues, and keep us healthy. If we eat a balanced diet, our body gets all the nutrients it needs. If not, we may get sick. Nutrition is very important for kids, for keeping our weight normal, and for staying healthy.
