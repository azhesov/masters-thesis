Computer security, or cybersecurity, is like protecting your home from burglars. It's all about keeping bad guys out and your stuff safe. These bad guys can be hackers, viruses, or tricks like phishing. To protect your computer and your info, you should use strong passwords, like a mix of letters, numbers, and symbols. You should also use something called encryption, which is like a secret code that only you can read. Firewalls are like security guards that watch what comes into your computer and block bad stuff. Always update your software, like when your mom tells you to clean your room. And, just like you shouldn't talk to strangers, don't click on weird links or open strange emails. It's also important to learn about these threats so you can stay safe.",9.4,55.54,12.2,12.5,11.03,12.93,5.21,12.833333333333334
