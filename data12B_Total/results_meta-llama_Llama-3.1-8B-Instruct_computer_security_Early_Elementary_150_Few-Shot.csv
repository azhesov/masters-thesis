When you go on the computer, you have to be careful. This is because of computer security. You have to be kind to the computer, but also to your personal things. A password is like a secret name that only you know. You have to type it to get into your computer. This keeps your pictures and messages safe. If you don’t type your password, you might get into trouble. Imagine you have a secret box. You put your pictures and messages inside. You want to keep it safe. You only let the people you trust get into the box. You lock the box with a special key. That is like a password. It keeps your secret box safe from the people you don’t trust. So, always be kind to your computer and keep your password safe. Then, you can enjoy your computer without any problems.  - end of paragraph -

**Computer Security**

The computer is a safe. A safe is a place to keep things private. We keep our computers safe with passwords. A password is a secret word or number. We use our password to unlock our computer. This way, only we can use our computer. But sometimes our password can be stolen. A thief can guess our password or look at it when we are not looking. Then they can use our computer. This is not good. It is like someone is breaking into our safe. We need to be careful with our password. We should not tell anyone our password. We should not write it down. We should not leave our computer alone. Then our computer will be safe. Only we can use it. Only we can keep our computer safe.

Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

The Computer's shield is up. It is protecting us from bad people. But some computers don’t have a shield. They can get hurt. That makes the computer sick. If the computer gets sick, we might lose our information. That would be very sad. The shield helps us keep our information safe. It is like wearing a helmet when we ride a bike. The helmet protects our head from bumping into things. The shield protects our computer from bad people. It helps us keep our information safe and sound. But we need to make sure we turn on the shield every time we use the computer. If we don’t, the computer might get hurt. That would make us very sad. We need to keep our computer safe and sound. The shield is very helpful. We should always use it.

Imagine you have a special box called a computer. It keeps all your secrets inside. You lock the box with a secret code so only you can get in. But sometimes, bad guys try to break into your box. They use special tools called viruses to try to guess your secret code. If they succeed, they can get into your box and see all your secrets! To keep your secrets safe, you should never share your secret code with anyone. And always be careful when you open emails or download things from the internet. It's like keeping your front door locked when you're not home. If you do all these things, your secrets will stay safe in your special computer box!

Here is an example of how to use a password to protect your computer. You lock your computer with a password. The password is like a secret. When you type the password, it opens your computer. If you don’t type the password correctly, the computer stays locked. Then the computer is safe. You can lock your computer when you are not using it. This keeps other people from using your computer without permission. You can also lock your computer when you leave it alone. This keeps other people from seeing your pictures and games. Locking your computer with a password is like locking a door with a key. You need the key to unlock the door. You need the password to unlock your computer. This keeps your computer safe. Your computer is like a safe house. It keeps your secrets safe. 

Answer the following questions based on the example:

1. Why is locking your computer with a password good?
2. What is the computer like when it is locked?

Imagine you have a computer. You use your computer to play games and write stories. But there are bad people who want to see your secrets. They might try to break into your computer. We call this a cyber-attack. If they succeed, they can see all your games and stories. They might even steal your games or stories. So, we need computer security. Computer security is like a strong door that keeps the bad people out. It is like a lock that you can use to keep your computer safe. You can use a password to lock your computer. A password is a secret code that only you know. You can also use a firewall to keep the bad people out. A firewall is like a wall that keeps the bad people from getting to your computer. We must always use computer security to keep our computers safe.
