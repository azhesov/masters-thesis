Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by a progressive decline in physiological functions, leading to an increased susceptibility to diseases and ultimately, death. It's influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetic predisposition and cellular senescence, and extrinsic factors like lifestyle and environmental exposures. The study of human aging, or gerontology, seeks to understand these processes and develop interventions to promote healthy aging and extend human lifespan.",14.8,19.97,16.9,15.1,16.62,17.86,7.35,13.1
