Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 200 words. Prehistory is the span of time before written records were created, which includes the Stone Age. This period is divided into three main eras: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic, also known as the Old Stone Age, began around 2.6 million years ago and ended approximately 10,000 years ago. This era was characterized by the use of stone tools and the emergence of early humans like Homo habilis and Homo sapiens. The Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age, started around 10,000 BC and lasted until the advent of agriculture, around 8,000 BC. During this time, humans were transitioning from a nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyle to more settled communities. The Neolithic, or New Stone Age, began around 8,000 BC and ended with the Bronze Age, around 3,300 BC.

The study of prehistory relies heavily on archaeology, which uses artifacts and physical remains to understand past cultures. This is particularly important in prehistory, as written records are not available. Archaeologists excavate sites, date artifacts using methods like radiocarbon dating, and interpret the findings within their cultural and historical contexts. This helps reconstruct the lives of our early ancestors and provides insights into how human societies evolved over time.",10.8,46.57,12.3,12.9,12.24,13.05,5.49,8.142857142857142

During the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), humans were hunter-gatherers using stone tools. The Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age) saw the development of more complex tools and societies. In the Neolithic (New Stone Age), humans began farming and using polished stone tools. The Bronze Age marked a significant technological advance with the use of bronze for tools and weapons.
