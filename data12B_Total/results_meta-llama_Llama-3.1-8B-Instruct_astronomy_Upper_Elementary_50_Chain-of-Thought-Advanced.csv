Astronomy is the study of the universe. It includes stars, planets, and space. People look at the stars with telescopes. They try to find new stars and learn about them. They also study the planets. They look at the Earth and the other planets. They try to learn about the sun and the moon. They also study the stars that are far away. The people who study this are called astronomers. They are very smart and like to learn about the universe. They try to figure out how it all works. They use special tools like telescopes and computers. They also look at pictures taken by the space shuttle. They try to learn everything they can about the universe. It is a very big job.
