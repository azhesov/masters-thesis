Prehistory is the time period before written records. It begins with the earliest human beings and ends with the invention of writing. During this time, people developed complex societies, created art and tools, and migrated across the globe. The earliest human civilizations, such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus Valley Civilization, emerged in this period. Archaeologists study prehistory by analyzing artifacts, fossils, and other physical evidence. For example, the discovery of ancient pottery and tools has helped scholars understand the development of human societies and cultures.

Prehistory refers to the vast expanse of time before written records, spanning millions of years and encompassing the emergence of early humans and the development of complex societies.  This period is characterized by the lack of written documentation, leaving historians and archaeologists to rely on physical evidence and oral traditions to reconstruct the past.  The study of prehistory is a multifaceted discipline, incorporating anthropology, sociology, and archaeology to provide a comprehensive understanding of human evolution and cultural development.  Through the analysis of artifacts, fossil records, and environmental data, researchers can piece together a narrative of human history, from the earliest hominins to the rise of civilizations.  This knowledge is essential for understanding our shared human heritage and the complexities of our globalized world.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Advanced College level.
To explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Advanced College level, I would need to provide a detailed and technical definition that acknowledges the complexities and nuances of the subject. This would involve explaining the time period before written records existed, the reliance on archaeological evidence, and the various methods used to reconstruct the past.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
To convey a sense of sophistication and technicality, I would use vocabulary such as ""archaeological record,"" ""Paleolithic era,"" and ""methodological approaches."" I would also use complex sentence structures to convey the multifaceted nature of prehistory, incorporating phrases like ""due to the absence of written records,""",11.1,45.66,13.4,12.6,11.95,13.4,5.17,7.142857142857142

Here is a 100-word paragraph on 'prehistory':
The era known as prehistory is the time period preceding written records. Beginning approximately 2.5 million years ago, this vast period encompasses the emergence and development of early human societies, including Neanderthals, Homo sapiens, and other extinct species. These early humans relied on tools, language, and cultural practices to survive and adapt in various environments. The absence of written records does not mean that the events of prehistory were unimportant or uneventful. In fact, the complexity and diversity of human societies during this time laid the groundwork for the civilizations that followed.

Revised paragraph:
The era of prehistory, spanning from approximately 2.5 million years ago to the advent of written records, is a vast and complex period marked by the emergence and development of early human societies. These societies, including Neanderthals and Homo sapi",10.1,48.3,11.8,12.2,10.03,13.1,4.85,7.125

Here's my paragraph:
Prehistory, a term coined by the Danish archaeologist Christian Jürgensen Thomsen in the 19th century, refers to the period of human history before written records existed. This era, spanning from the emergence of the first hominins around 6 million years ago to the advent of writing systems in ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus Valley, is characterized by the development of various technologies, social structures, and cultural practices. Through archaeological excavations and other methods, researchers have reconstructed a narrative of human prehistory, highlighting key milestones, such as the control of fire, the domestication of plants and animals, and the development of complex societies.
Step 4: Consider what kind of question might be asked about the paragraph in response to it, and how I would answer it.

Here's the plan in paragraph form:

Prehistory is the vast, unrecorded period of human existence that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of written records, around 5,200 years ago.  This era encompasses the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods, characterized by the development of stone tools, the domestication of animals, and the establishment of settled agricultural communities.  During this time, human societies evolved and transformed, shaped by environmental pressures, technological innovations, and cultural practices.  As a result, the course of human history was profoundly influenced by the events and trends of prehistory.
