Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?"" But the owl says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose. Maybe it is her egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, ""Is this your egg?""

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words. In prehistory, people didn’t use paper or pens. They lived in the time before writing. Instead, they used pictures to tell stories. These pictures were called cave paintings. They painted on the walls of caves. They painted animals and people. The paintings were made with colors from plants, dirt, and charcoal. Some paintings are still there today. You can see them in museums. People in prehistory used these paintings to tell their stories and to teach. These paintings help us learn about their lives.",1.5,97.6,2.2,6.3,4.27,3.38,2.49,2.1875

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words. Prehistory is the period before written records began. In prehistory, people lived without books or newspapers. They did not have ways to write down their stories. So, we do not know many things about life in prehistory. But we can learn about it in other ways. Scientists look at bones and stones from that time. They study how people lived and what they did. They also look at pictures that people drew on walls. These pictures show us what animals and plants were around. From these clues, we can learn about prehistory.",1.6,97.4,2.1,6.6,4.51,3.15,2.48,2.1875

In prehistory, humans lived long ago. They lived before we had writing. People in prehistory walked, talked, and played. They found food like fruits, vegetables, and meat. They lived with animals, like dogs. Some people made tools. They used rocks, bones, and wood. Some people painted pictures on walls. These pictures showed animals and their lives. Today, scientists study these pictures and tools. They learn about how people lived in prehistory.",1.5,97.8,2.2,6.5,4.32,3.14,2.46,2.1875

Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?"" But the owl says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose. Maybe it is her egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, ""Is this your egg?"" But the goose says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the two ducks. Maybe it is their egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the two ducks. They ask the two ducks, ""Is this your egg?"" But the two ducks say, ""No, that is not our egg."" Then the egg breaks.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words. Prehistory is the period of time before written history began.

In the old times, long before people could write, there were no books or newspapers. People did not leave behind pictures or words to tell us about their lives. This time is called prehistory. During prehistory, people walked around on Earth. They did not live in big houses or cities. They did not have cars or computers. Instead, they lived in small groups and moved around a lot. They found food and made tools from what they found in nature. Some people painted pictures on the walls of caves. These pictures are the only things left from prehistory that we can see today.",1.7,97.09,2.3,6.6,4.48,3.56,2.53,2.1875

In prehistory, people lived long ago. They lived before there were books or cars. They didn’t use pencils or computers. Prehistoric people lived in caves. They hunted for food.
