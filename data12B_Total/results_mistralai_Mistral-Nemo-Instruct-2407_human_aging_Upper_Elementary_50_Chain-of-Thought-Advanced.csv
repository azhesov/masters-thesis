Original: Human aging is a complex process involving gradual changes at cellular, molecular, and physiological levels. These changes accumulate over time, leading to an increased risk of diseases and functional decline.

Simplified: As people get older, their cells and bodies change slowly. These changes build up over time, making it harder for the body to work well and increasing the chance of getting sick.

Here's my attempt:

Human aging is a natural process where our bodies change over time. It starts from birth, but we notice it more as we grow older. Our cells divide and reproduce, but with age, they don't work as well. This leads to wrinkles, gray hair, and slower movements. Our organs also age, making us more prone to diseases like heart disease or Alzheimer's. Aging is a complex process influenced by both our genes and our lifestyle. While we can't stop it, we can slow it down by eating healthily, exercising, and avoiding harmful habits like smoking.
