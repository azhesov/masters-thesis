Here's the text I came up with:

Prehistory is a period of time that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the beginning of recorded history. It is a time when humans did not leave behind written records, so we rely on archaeological evidence and oral traditions to understand what life was like during this era. Prehistory can be divided into several distinct periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each characterized by significant technological and cultural developments. During prehistory, humans learned to control fire, domesticate plants and animals, and develop more complex societies. The study of prehistory allows us to gain insights into the evolution of human societies and cultures, and how they adapted to their environments. By examining the artifacts and remains from prehistoric times, we can reconstruct the past and better understand the present.

The study of prehistory is the examination of the past before written records were kept. This time period, which stretches back millions of years, encompasses the emergence of early humans, their development, and the cultures they created. Prehistorians use various methods to reconstruct the past, including archaeology, which is the study of material remains like tools, artifacts, and structures. They also employ geological and paleontological techniques to analyze the earth's layers and fossil record. 
Prehistory is often divided into distinct periods, each characterized by significant events and developments. The Paleolithic Era, for example, is marked by the emergence of early humans and the development of basic tools. The Neolithic Era, on the other hand, is distinguished by the invention of agriculture and the rise of more complex societies. 
The study of prehistory provides valuable insights into the evolution of human societies and the cultures that have shaped our world. By examining the past, prehistorians",9.7,49.41,11.5,12.2,11.68,13.16,5.11,5.1

Prehistory, the time before written records, is a period that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing. It's a vast and complex era that encompasses various stages of human evolution, technological advancements, and cultural developments. During prehistory, early humans developed tools, hunted and gathered food, and formed social structures. They also migrated to different parts of the world, adapting to new environments and climates. The study of prehistory relies on archaeological evidence, such as artifacts, fossils, and rock art, to reconstruct the lives of our ancestors. By examining these remains, scientists can gain insights into the daily lives, rituals, and traditions of prehistoric people, providing a glimpse into a time long past.

Prehistory is a term that refers to the period of time before written records existed. During this time, humans lived without the benefit of written language, which made it difficult to leave behind a permanent record of their lives and achievements. Despite the lack of written records, archaeologists and anthropologists have been able to reconstruct the lives of our ancestors through the study of artifacts, fossils, and other remains. They have discovered evidence of early human societies, including tools, shelters, and artwork, which provide clues about the ways in which people lived, hunted, and interacted with one another. By studying these artifacts and remains, researchers have been able to piece together a narrative of human history that stretches back millions of years, from the emergence of the first hominids to the development of complex societies. The study of prehistory is an ongoing process, and new discoveries are continually shedding light on the lives of our ancient",9.8,54.63,12.6,12.5,11.62,12.82,5.33,6.111111111111111

Prehistory is the time period before written records were kept. It is the period of human history before the invention of writing. This period is often divided into the Paleolithic Age, Mesolithic Age, and Neolithic Age. During the Paleolithic Age, people lived in small groups and hunted and gathered for food. They also made tools and shelter from stone, wood, and animal hides. In the Mesolithic Age, people began to settle in one place and develop more complex societies. They also developed more sophisticated tools and started to domesticate animals. In the Neolithic Age, people developed agriculture and started to live in more permanent settlements. They also developed more complex social structures and started to trade with other groups.

The final answer is: 
Prehistory refers to the period of time before written records were kept. It began around 5 million years ago and ended with the invention of writing, which occurred independently in various parts of the world around 3,500-4,000 years ago. During this time, human societies developed complex systems of social organization, technology, and culture. These developments were not always gradual, and some were the result of sudden innovations that transformed entire societies. For example, the invention of agriculture in the Fertile Crescent around 10,000 years ago allowed for population growth and the emergence of complex societies. Similarly, the development of metalworking in the Near East around 6,000 years ago enabled the creation of more efficient tools and the expansion of trade networks. The study of prehistory seeks to understand the processes that led to these developments and the ways",9.1,56.35,11.8,12.1,10.98,12.52,5.02,5.888888888888889

Prehistory refers to the time period before written records began, spanning from the emergence of the first humans, Homo sapiens, to the invention of writing around 5,000 years ago. During this era, human societies developed and evolved without leaving behind a written legacy, making it a subject of inference and interpretation by archaeologists and historians. The prehistoric period is often divided into three main stages: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic, which lasted from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago, is characterized by the use of stone tools and the development of early human societies. The Mesolithic, spanning from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago, saw the emergence of more complex societies and the introduction of new technologies.

Prehistory is a period of time that comes before written records. It is the era when humans first developed into modern species. This period is also known as the time before history, as there are no written accounts of events that occurred during this time. The prehistoric era is generally divided into three periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During the Paleolithic period, early humans developed basic tools and lived in caves. The Mesolithic period saw the development of more complex societies and the use of more advanced tools. The Neolithic period marked the beginning of agriculture and the domestication of animals. The prehistoric era came to an end with the rise of civilizations and the creation of written records.
