Step 3: Write a paragraph of 150 words that follows your plan. Include interesting facts about astronomy.
Astronomy is the study of objects in our universe. It includes the study of planets, stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies. The word ""astronomy"" comes from the Greek words ""aster,"" meaning ""star,"" and ""nomos,"" meaning ""law."" Astronomers use telescopes to observe these objects and learn about their sizes, temperatures, and movements. They also study the life cycles of stars, which can range from a few million years to billions of years. One interesting fact is that the nearest star to our solar system, besides the Sun, is Proxima Centauri, which is about 4.2 light-years away. This means that if we were to travel to Proxima Centauri at the speed of light, it would take about 4.2 years. Astronomers continue to explore the universe, discovering new stars, planets, and galaxies, and learning more about the mysteries of the cosmos.
