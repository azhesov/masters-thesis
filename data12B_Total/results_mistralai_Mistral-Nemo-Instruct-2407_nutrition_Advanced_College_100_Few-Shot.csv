Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

Nutrition is the intake of food and drink to maintain health and growth.

Malnutrition, the result of inadequate or unbalanced nutrition, can lead to various health issues, including obesity, anemia, and weakened immune system. Balanced diets, regular physical activity, and adequate hydration are key to maintaining good nutrition, while understanding food labels and portion sizes can help prevent overconsumption.",15.2,35.1,18.2,17.5,18.26,13.93,7.51,19.25

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

""Nutrition"" is the process of consuming food and drink to sustain life and growth. Adequate nutrition involves consuming a balanced diet, containing essential nutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Insufficient or imbalanced nutrition can lead to various health issues, such as malnutrition and obesity.

Nutrition, the process of obtaining and utilizing food to sustain life and growth, is a complex and multifaceted field. It involves diverse aspects, including macro and micronutrients, metabolism, absorption, digestion, and the intricate interplay of these processes with overall health and well-being. The science of nutrition has evolved significantly over time, with numerous books and research papers delving into its intricacies. From the discovery of vitamins to the understanding of obesity, the field continues to grow and adapt, reflecting our evolving understanding of the human body and its nutritional needs.",15.4,34.49,18.6,17.5,18.28,13.93,7.46,19.25
