To calculate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of the output, we have:
- Total words = 43
- Total sentences = 1
- Total syllables = 161 (calculated manually)

Using the formula:
0.39 × (43 / 1) + 11.8 × (161 / 43) - 15.59 ≈ 8.7

The output has a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 8.7, which is slightly above the target of 8, but still considered easily understandable",7.4,60.72,9.8,10.5,8.46,11.06,4.29,5.666666666666667
