When we eat, our body breaks down the food into smaller parts. These parts are then used to build and fix our body's cells. Nutrition also helps us stay healthy by providing the right amounts of vitamins and minerals. Without the right amounts of these nutrients, we might get sick. Our body needs a balance of different foods to stay healthy and work well. A good diet is like putting the right kind of gasoline in a car - it helps the car run smoothly. By eating well, we can help our body run smoothly too.
