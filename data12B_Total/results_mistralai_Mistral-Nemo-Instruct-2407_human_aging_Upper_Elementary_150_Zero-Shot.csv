Human aging is a natural process that happens over time. As we grow older, our bodies and minds change. Our skin wrinkles, our hair turns gray, and we might need glasses to see clearly. We also become more likely to get certain health problems, like heart disease or diabetes. But aging isn't all bad! With age often comes wisdom and experience. Older adults have lived through many experiences, which can make them wiser and better at solving problems. They also have more time for hobbies and spending time with family and friends. So while aging brings changes, it's also a time for learning and enjoying life in new ways.",6.6,68.26,7.5,8.6,7.43,9.03,4.36,4.8

Human aging is the process by which our bodies change over time. As we grow older, our cells divide less often, making it harder for our bodies to repair themselves. This can lead to wrinkles, gray hair, and weaker bones. Our brains also change, which can make it harder to remember things. We might need glasses to see better, and our hearing may not be as sharp. These changes are a normal part of life, but scientists are always learning more about how to help us live healthier, happier lives as we age.",6.4,74.29,7.6,8.8,8.08,8.4,4.42,6.0
