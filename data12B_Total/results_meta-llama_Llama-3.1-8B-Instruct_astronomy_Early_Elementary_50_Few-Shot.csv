Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Stars are bright in the sky. The stars shine at night. But some stars are bright in the daytime too. This is because of the Sun. The Sun is very bright. The Sun makes some stars shine. The Sun's light travels far and far to reach us. The Sun's light makes the stars shine in the sky. They are beautiful to see. 

However, it would be more beneficial to make a new paragraph that stands on its own. Here is one:

The Earth goes around the Sun. We see the stars at night. The Earth gets in the way. If we looked at the Sun during the day, we would see the stars shining. But the Earth blocks our view. The Sun's light shines on the Earth. The stars are hidden from us. They are still up there, shining in space.

Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Astronomy is a big word. It means studying the sky. We study the stars, the planets, and the Sun. We want to know more about them. We want to know where they are, what they are, and how they work. We can see some things in the sky. We can also see some things in space.
