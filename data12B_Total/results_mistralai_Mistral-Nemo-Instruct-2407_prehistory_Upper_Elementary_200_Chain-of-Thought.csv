Prehistory is a time period that comes before written history. It's like when we talk about dinosaurs and cave people. These times were before people could write things down, so we don't have books or newspapers to tell us what happened. Instead, scientists use clues from the past, like fossils and ancient tools, to figure out what life was like. This is called archaeology. Prehistory is divided into different eras based on the tools and animals that were around. For example, the Stone Age is when people used tools made of stone. So, prehistory is like a big puzzle that scientists are always trying to put together.",7.3,66.54,7.9,10.1,8.32,8.8,3.89,6.375

- Use examples of early human activities like hunting, gathering, and making tools.
- Include transition words to connect ideas.

**Paragraph:**

Prehistory is the time before people wrote things down. Imagine living many, many years ago, when humans didn't have books, newspapers, or computers. Instead of reading about history, we have to use clues like fossils and artifacts to understand this time. In prehistory, people were hunters and gatherers. They lived in small groups and moved around a lot, following animals and plants for food. They didn't have farms or shops. Also, they made their own tools out of stone, wood, or bone. These tools helped them hunt, gather, and protect themselves. Over",6.4,68.87,9.1,9.8,8.04,10.59,3.72,5.4

""Prehistory is the time before humans started writing things down. It's like a big puzzle where we try to figure out how people lived long ago. We can't read books or letters from that time, so we use clues from art, tools, and even bones to piece together what life was like. Archaeologists are the detectives who solve this puzzle. They travel to places where people lived thousands of years ago and carefully examine everything they find. From these clues, they can tell us what people ate, how they made their tools, and even what they believed in. It's like going on a time-travel adventure, but instead of a magic machine, we use our brains and the clues from the past to explore how our ancestors lived.""",7.0,72.56,8.7,9.8,8.8,8.81,4.14,6.25

The time before we started recording history, which is called prehistory, is a fascinating period to explore. People lived as hunter-gatherers, relying on nature for their food and shelter. They didn't have books to write down their stories, so we have to find other ways to learn about their lives. Archaeologists, who are scientists that study the past, look at the tools and art that these early people made. They also study the bones of animals that were hunted for food. By examining these artifacts and remains, we can piece together what life was like before written records began.

**Answer:**

Prehistory is like the very, very long time before history started. You see, history is like a big book that tells us about the lives of people, their wars, and their inventions. But before people could write things down, there were no books. So, prehistory is the time before writing was invented, when people didn't keep records.

Imagine you're in a cave, thousands of years ago. There are no schools, no computers, no newspapers. People hunt for food, make tools from stones, and live in small groups. They tell stories by drawing pictures on cave walls. These pictures are some of the earliest forms of art and communication we have from prehistory.

Archaeologists, who are like detectives of the past, study these drawings and other things people left behind, like bones, tools, and pottery. By putting these pieces together, they",6.9,67.55,8.5,9.7,7.96,9.85,3.7,6.75

Prehistory is a long time ago when humans didn't write things down. It started about 6 million years ago and ended around 5,000 years ago. That's a really, really long time! During prehistory, humans were hunters and gatherers. This means they found food by hunting animals and gathering plants. They didn't have stores or farms. They lived in small groups called tribes. Each tribe had its own leader. They didn't have cars or computers either. Instead, they walked or used animals to travel. They used tools made of stone, wood, and bone. Life was hard, but they worked together to survive. This time period ended when people started to write things down. This is when we get history books.",4.8,78.45,6.3,8.8,6.38,8.21,3.27,6.375
