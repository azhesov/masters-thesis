Prehistory is the time period before people wrote down their history. Imagine that you're going back in time to a point when humans didn't have paper, pencils, or computers to record their stories.

**Paragraph**
Imagine you're a time traveler, and you go back to the earliest days of human history. That's called prehistory. It's a period of time before people kept written records. We can't find any written documents from that time, so we have to use other clues to figure out what life was like. Archaeologists, who are experts in old things, study the remains of ancient buildings, tools, and other artifacts. They also look at pictures and stories that were passed down from generation to generation. By studying these clues, we can learn about the people who lived during prehistory. They hunted and gathered food, made their own tools, and lived in small groups. We can also learn about the different cultures and civilizations that existed during this time. Prehistory is a fascinating topic that helps us understand how humans developed and grew over time.

Prehistory is the time before written records existed. It started at the beginning of the Earth and ended about 5,000 years ago. Before writing, people told stories and passed on information through pictures and carvings. Our ancestors were skilled hunters and gatherers who used tools made of stone, wood, and bone. They made homes out of animal hides and branches. Early humans were nomads, moving from place to place in search of food and shelter. They had limited technology and no written language. As time passed, people began to settle in one place and develop more complex societies. They learned to grow their own food, domesticate animals, and build permanent homes. This marked the beginning of the historical period, where written records started to appear. The discovery of writing and the development of civilizations allowed people to record their history, making it easier to share knowledge and learn from each other. Over time, written records have helped us understand the past and appreciate the journey of human progress.",7.4,66.13,9.9,10.9,9.95,11.42,4.36,5.777777777777778

Prehistory is the time period before written records existed. It is the period when humans lived and interacted with their environment, but did not leave behind written documents. This time period is broken down into three parts: the Paleolithic Era, the Mesolithic Era, and the Neolithic Era. During the Paleolithic Era, which is often called the Stone Age, humans first developed tools made from stones, bones, and wood. These early humans hunted and gathered food to survive. In the Mesolithic Era, humans began to make more sophisticated tools, such as bows and arrows, and started to settle in one place. The Neolithic Era, also known as the New Stone Age, saw the development of agriculture and the domestication of animals. People began to live in settled communities and developed more complex societies. By studying the artifacts and remains from prehistoric times, archaeologists can learn about the lives of our ancestors and how they lived, hunted, and interacted with one another.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level.
To explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level, we need to simplify the concept and use language that is easy to understand. Prehistory refers to the time period before written records were kept, which means we can't rely on written documents like books, newspapers, or diaries to learn about this time. Instead, archaeologists and historians use other sources like fossils, artifacts, and oral traditions to reconstruct what life was like.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For this audience, we should use simple vocabulary and sentence structures that are easy to follow. For example, instead of saying ""the period before the advent of written records,"" we can say ""the time before people started writing things down."" This way, the reader can understand the concept without",9.6,55.13,12.1,11.7,9.96,12.47,4.49,8.0

Prehistory is a very long time ago, even before our country was founded. It's a time when humans didn't write or leave many records. We have to learn about it from the things they left behind, like old tools, buildings, and artifacts. These things help us understand how people lived, what they ate, and how they protected themselves from the weather and wild animals.

Prehistory is the time before writing was invented. It was a long, long time ago, before people knew how to write down their stories, histories, and ideas. During this time, people lived in small groups and communities, hunting and gathering food, and farming the land. They made tools out of stone, wood, and bone. They also made shelters from sticks, leaves, and animal hides.
The people of prehistory were very skilled at making things. They could make sharp knives, axes, and spears. They could also make pottery, which is a type of container made from clay. They used these containers to store food, water, and other important things. The people of prehistory also made beautiful art, such as cave paintings and carvings. These artworks told stories and showed important events. They also helped to keep people connected to their culture and traditions.

Prehistory is a time period before written records were kept. This means that we don't have written documents to tell us about the events of this time. Archaeologists, people who study past cultures, use other ways to learn about the past, such as by finding and studying old artifacts and buildings. They can learn about what people ate, where they lived, and how they made tools. For example, if archaeologists find old stone tools, they can figure out what kind of rocks were used to make them and what kind of jobs people might have done with them. They can also learn about the environment that people lived in by looking at the plants and animals that lived there at the same time. By studying all of these clues, archaeologists can piece together a picture of what life was like in prehistory. This can be really interesting and help us understand how people lived a long time ago.

Here is my response:

Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level.
To explain 'prehistory' to an upper elementary student, I would want to use vocabulary that is familiar to them, but also give them a sense of the time period we're discussing. I would want to explain that it's the time before written records existed, and that we learn about it through other methods like archaeology and artifacts.

Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
I would use vocabulary like ""ancient,"" ""old,"" and ""fossils"" to help them understand the time period. I would also use simple sentence structure, like short paragraphs, to keep them engaged.
