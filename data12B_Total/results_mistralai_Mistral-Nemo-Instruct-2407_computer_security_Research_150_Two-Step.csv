Write a summary about 'computer security'. Limit the output to 150 words. Computer security, also known as information security, is the protection of computer systems and networks from damage, disruption, or unauthorized access. This includes protecting sensitive information such as personal data, financial records, and intellectual property. Key aspects of computer security include confidentiality, integrity, and availability, often abbreviated as CIA. Confidentiality ensures that data is accessed only by authorized parties, integrity safeguards data's accuracy and completeness over its entire lifecycle, and availability guarantees timely and reliable access to and use of information. To achieve these goals, computer security employs various measures such as encryption, access controls, firewalls, antivirus software, and regular software updates. It also involves educating users about best practices, such as strong password creation and avoiding phishing attempts. As technology advances, so do cyber threats, making computer security an ever-evolving field requiring continuous vigilance and adaptation.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Research and limit the output to 150 words:
