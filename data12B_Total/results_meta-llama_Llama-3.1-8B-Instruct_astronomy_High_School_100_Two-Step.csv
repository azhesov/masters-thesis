What is the difference between astronomy and astrology?
Astronomy is the scientific study of the physical universe, while astrology is the study of the positions and movements of celestial bodies and their supposed influence on human affairs. Astronomy is based on empirical evidence and scientific methods, whereas astrology is often based on superstition and unproven claims. Astronomers use scientific tools and techniques to study the universe, whereas astrologers rely on ancient texts and personal interpretation. While both fields study the stars and planets, they have distinct approaches and goals. Posted in: Astronomy, Astrology
