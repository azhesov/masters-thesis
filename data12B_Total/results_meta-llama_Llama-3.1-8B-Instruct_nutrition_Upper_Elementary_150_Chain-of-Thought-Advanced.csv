Nutrition is important for our body. It helps us grow strong and healthy. Food is our main source of nutrition. We need to eat different kinds of food to get all the nutrients our body needs. There are three main groups of food: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates give us energy, proteins help build our body, and fats help us keep warm. Fruits and vegetables are also important for our nutrition. They are rich in vitamins and minerals. We should eat a variety of food to get all the nutrients our body needs. Eating healthy food will help us stay healthy and strong. It will also help us feel happy and have lots of energy. Our body needs the right amount of nutrition to work properly.
