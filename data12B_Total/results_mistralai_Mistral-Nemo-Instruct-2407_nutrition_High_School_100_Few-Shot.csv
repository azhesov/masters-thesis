Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

The calculator automatically follows the conventional order of operations. 
You can setup your calculator to work either in natural display or linear display. Natural display causes fractions, irrational numbers, expressions, and certain functions to be displayed as you see them on paper. Linear display causes fractions and other expressions to be displayed in a line.

Nutrition is the process by which humans and animals consume and use food to maintain their bodies. Proper nutrition provides essential nutrients like proteins, vitamins, and minerals. These nutrients support growth, repair, and energy production. Consuming a balanced diet ensures that one receives adequate amounts of these nutrients. This can be achieved by eating a variety of foods, including fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains. Regular exercise also plays a crucial role in maintaining optimal nutrition, as it helps the body use these nutrients effectively.",10.6,52.49,12.3,13.8,12.12,11.84,5.31,15.25

Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

There is no specific scientific calculator prescribed for this subject. Any scientific, nonprogrammable calculator is suitable for your studies. Different scientific calculators have different functions and it is up to you to know your calculator. Most scientific calculators have algebraic logic; the operation in an expression can be entered in the calculator in the order in which the expression is read (left to right). The calculator automatically follows the conventional order of operations. 
You can setup your calculator to work either in natural display or linear display. Natural display causes fractions, irrational numbers, expressions, and certain functions to be displayed as you see them on paper. Linear display causes fractions and other expressions to be displayed in a line.
