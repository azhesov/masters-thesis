Nutrition, in the context of advanced scientific research, refers to the process by which organisms assimilate and utilize food to sustain life and promote growth. This involves intricate biochemical pathways that convert macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, lipids) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) into energy and essential biological molecules. Understanding these complex interactions is crucial for unraveling the molecular underpinnings of health and disease.",12.8,30.57,14.9,14.1,15.84,16.0,6.53,10.571428571428571
