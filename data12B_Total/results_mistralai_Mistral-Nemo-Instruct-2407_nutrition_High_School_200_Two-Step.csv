Write a summary about 'nutrition'. Limit the output to 200 words. 'Nutrition' refers to the process of providing and utilizing food to meet the body's dietary needs. It encompasses the intake of food, absorption, and utilization of nutrients to support growth, maintenance, and repair of tissues, and to provide energy. Adequate nutrition is crucial for overall health, preventing chronic diseases, and maintaining a healthy weight. Key nutrients include macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and micronutrients like vitamins and minerals. A balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, is recommended for optimal nutrition. Poor nutrition, conversely, can lead to malnutrition, obesity, and various health problems. Regular physical activity, hydration, and a healthy diet are fundamental to good nutrition and overall well-being.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 200 words:

Revised text:

Nutrition is about eating food that your body needs to stay healthy. It's a science that studies how your body uses nutrients. Good nutrition helps your body grow, work well, and fight off diseases. It also helps you maintain a healthy weight. Your body needs five main types of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Carbs give you energy, proteins help build and repair your body, fats protect your organs, and vitamins and minerals support various body functions. Eating a balanced diet ensures you get enough of these nutrients. Too much or too little can cause problems like malnutrition or obesity. Drinking enough water is also important for digestion and overall health. Regular exercise along with good nutrition helps keep you fit and healthy. In short, understanding and maintaining good nutrition is vital for your overall health.",9.7,49.31,12.2,13.2,10.23,14.14,4.71,8.0
