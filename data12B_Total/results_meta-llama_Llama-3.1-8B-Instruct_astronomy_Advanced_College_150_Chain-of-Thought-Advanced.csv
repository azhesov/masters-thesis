Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. It involves observing and understanding the properties and behavior of stars, planets, galaxies, and other objects in the universe. Astronomers use a variety of techniques, including telescopes, spacecraft, and computer simulations, to gather data and make observations. They also develop theories and models to explain the phenomena they observe, and test these theories through experimentation and further observation. By studying the universe, astronomers can gain insights into the origins and evolution of the cosmos, as well as the potential for life beyond Earth.
