Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. It's characterized by gradual declines in physical and cognitive functions, as well as increased vulnerability to age-related diseases such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Aging affects quality of life and mortality. 
What are the major causes of human aging?
Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process influenced by several factors, including:
1. **Genetic factors**: The length of telomeres, which cap the ends of chromosomes, shortens with age, contributing to aging.
2. **Environmental factors**: Exposure to stress, pollution, and UV radiation accelerates aging.
3. **Lifestyle factors**: Poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and excessive alcohol consumption contribute to aging.
4. **Epigenetic changes**: Alterations in gene expression influence aging.

Human aging is a complex process influenced by several factors, including genetic, environmental, lifestyle, epigenetic changes, and mitochondrial dysfunction.

Let's break down the causes of human aging into simpler terms:

**Genetic factors** make you more likely to age faster.
**Environmental factors** like pollution and stress can speed up aging.
**Lifestyle choices** like diet, exercise, and smoking can affect how fast you age.
**Epigenetic changes** are like switches that turn genes on and off, influencing aging.
**Mitochondrial dysfunction** means your cells have trouble making energy, which can lead to aging.

As people age, their bodies change in many ways. Skin gets wrinkles and age spots, hair turns gray, and muscles weaken. Bones get less dense, and organs work less well. Some people's brains slow down, making it harder to remember things, focus, and think quickly. Metabolisms change, causing weight gain and increasing the risk of diseases. Older people's immune systems get weaker, making them more likely to get sick. All these changes make it harder to live a healthy life and can make people more likely to get hurt.
