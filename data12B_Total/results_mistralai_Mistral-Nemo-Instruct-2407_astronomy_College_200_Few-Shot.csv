Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry to explain their properties and behaviors. Astronomy is divided into two main branches: observational astronomy, which collects and analyzes data from telescopes, and theoretical astronomy, which develops and tests models and theories to explain observed phenomena. Both branches work together to expand our understanding of the universe.",13.5,39.57,15.6,15.6,14.54,13.7,6.2,17.75

Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Astronomy is the study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. Its primary goal is to understand the origins and evolution of the universe. Astronomers achieve this through observing, measuring, and interpreting the electromagnetic radiation emitted by celestial bodies. They also use theoretical models and computational tools to explain the data collected. The ultimate aim of astronomy is to comprehend the cosmos in its entirety, from the smallest subatomic particles to the largest galaxies.",13.0,40.79,14.6,15.3,14.32,12.76,6.04,17.75

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. Telescopes, often mounted on the ground or in space, are instruments used to observe and record data from these objects, such as stars, planets, galaxies, and black holes. Astronomy aims to understand the physical properties, formation, and evolution of these celestial bodies, as well as the laws that govern their motion and interaction. This field of study also encompasses the history, technology, and ethics of astronomical research.",14.0,38.25,15.8,15.8,15.07,13.12,6.29,17.75
