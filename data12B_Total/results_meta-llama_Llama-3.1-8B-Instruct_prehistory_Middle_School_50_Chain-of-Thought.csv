Prehistory is the time before written records. People lived and worked, but they didn't leave behind written stories. We can still learn about prehistory by studying the things they made, like tools and buildings, and the pictures they drew on walls.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Middle School level.
To explain 'prehistory' to a Middle School reader, I need to break it down in a way that's easy to understand. I should mention that prehistory is the time before written records, which can be a bit abstract, so I'll try to make it more concrete by using examples of what people left behind.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For a Middle School reader, I'll use vocabulary that's not too complicated. I'll use simple sentence structures to make the paragraph easy to follow. I'll also try to make it engaging by including a few interesting details, like the pictures people",8.0,64.61,9.6,9.7,7.67,9.79,3.84,6.125

Here is the text of the paragraph after these steps:
Prehistory refers to the time before written records existed. During this time, people hunted, farmed, and lived in small groups. They made tools from stone, wood, and bone. The earliest humans, like Homo sapiens, evolved in Africa over 200,000 years ago.

Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Middle School level.
I need to break down the concept of prehistory into simple terms that a middle schooler can understand. This means explaining what prehistory is and what life was like during that time. I also need to consider what kind of examples or events would be interesting and relevant to a middle school audience.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Middle School level.
To explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Middle School level, we should focus on the basic definition and the key events that occurred during that time period. We should use simple vocabulary and sentence structure to make it easy to understand.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
To make the explanation clear and concise, we should use vocabulary that is familiar to middle school readers. We can use simple sentence structures and short paragraphs to keep the reader engaged. For example, instead of using complex vocabulary like 'archaeological sites' or 'paleoanthropological records', we can use",9.1,56.45,11.0,10.9,8.84,11.77,4.27,6.625

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Middle School level.
To explain 'prehistory' to a Middle School reader, we need to start with what they might know and build from there. We can begin by saying that history usually starts with written records, but before that, there were people living and making history, even if we don't have written records of it.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
We should use vocabulary and sentence structures that a Middle School reader can understand. We can use simple sentences and definitions of technical terms to help clarify the explanation. For example, we can explain that 'prehistory' is the study of people who lived before we had writing, which means we have to look at things like artifacts, tools, and how they lived.
