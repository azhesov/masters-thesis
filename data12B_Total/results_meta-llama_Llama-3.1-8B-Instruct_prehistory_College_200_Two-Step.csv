This period is divided into several stages, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras. The Paleolithic era, which dates from around 2.5 million years ago, saw the emergence of early humans, such as Homo habilis, who used simple tools and hunted for food.

Prehistory, spanning from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of recorded history, is a period characterized by the absence of written records and the reliance on archaeological evidence and oral traditions to reconstruct the past. This era encompasses the development of human societies from early human-like species to complex societies, and is typically divided into three phases: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras. The Paleolithic era marks the early human development and the use of tools, while the Mesolithic era represents a transition to more complex societies and the development of more sophisticated tools.

The prehistory of humanity spans from the emergence of the first humans in Africa approximately 6 million years ago to the advent of written records. This era is typically segmented into three distinct phases: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. During the Paleolithic era, the initial stone tools, fire, and language developed. The Mesolithic era witnessed the emergence of more complex societies, with the utilization of microliths. The Neolithic era marked the beginning of agriculture and animal domestication, leading to the establishment of settled communities. The prehistoric period concluded with the rise of civilizations and the invention of writing, signaling the commencement of recorded history. This period holds significance as it established the groundwork for human societies, cultures, and civilizations. It also offers valuable insights into human evolution, behavior, technology, and the natural environment.
