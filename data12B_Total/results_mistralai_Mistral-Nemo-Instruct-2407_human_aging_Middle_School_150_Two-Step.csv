Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Human aging is a complex process characterized by progressive physiological changes, increasing susceptibility to diseases, and ultimately, death. It is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetics and cellular senescence, and extrinsic factors like lifestyle and environment. Key changes include telomere shortening, DNA damage, and altered cellular metabolism, leading to impaired tissue maintenance and repair. Age-related diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders become more prevalent. Aging is also associated with cognitive decline, loss of physical function, and increased risk of frailty. The study of aging, or gerontology, aims to understand and mitigate these processes to improve healthspan and lifespan.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Middle School and limit the output to 150 words:

Human aging is a complex biological process that occurs at the cellular and molecular levels, resulting in an increased likelihood of diseases and a higher risk of death. Key concepts include:

1. **Telomere shortening**: Telomeres are protective caps at the ends of our chromosomes that shorten as cells divide. Once they become too short, the cell can no longer divide and eventually dies.

2. **DNA damage and mutations**: Over time, DNA can accumulate damage and mutations, leading to cellular dysfunction and contributing to age-related diseases.

3. **Mitochondrial dysfunction**: Mitochondria, the powerhouses of cells, can become less efficient and produce harmful reactive oxygen species as we age, causing further cellular damage.

4. **Inflammation**: Chronic, low-grade inflammation, known as ""inflammaging,"" can lead to tissue damage and contribute to age-related","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Middle School and limit the output to 150 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. A brief overview is sufficient.

Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive functional decline and increased susceptibility to disease and death. It is influenced by a combination of genetic, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Key aspects include:

1. **Genetic Factors**: Some aging processes are inherent, determined by genes like Werner syndrome and Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome.

2. **Cellular Changes**: At the cellular level, telomeres shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular senescence or apoptosis (programmed cell death).

3. **Molecular Mechanisms**: Accumulation of oxidative damage, epigenetic changes, and alterations in proteostasis contribute to aging.

4. **Lifestyle and Environmental Factors**: Regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and minimal exposure to toxins can slow aging processes.

5. **Health Implications**: Aging is the primary risk factor for many diseases, including cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Middle School and limit the output to 150 words:
