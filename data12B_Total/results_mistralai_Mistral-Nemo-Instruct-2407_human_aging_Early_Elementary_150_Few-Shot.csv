Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. The paragraph should provide a simple explanation of what aging is, mention that it happens to all living things, and briefly discuss how humans change as they age.

Example:
Aging is when a living thing gets older. All living things age. This includes plants, animals, and humans. When humans age, they change. Their bodies grow and change shape. They become taller, stronger, and sometimes, heavier. Their hair color changes, too. When they are babies, they have no hair, or it's soft and black. As they grow older, their hair grows longer, and its color changes to brown, red, or gray. Sometimes, it falls out, too.",1.7,97.3,2.4,6.1,4.17,3.26,2.59,2.1875

Time affects humans. It makes us grow. When we are babies, we are very small. We grow bigger every day. Time also makes us old. When we are old, we have less hair. Our hair turns gray, then white.

People grow older. They start small, like babies. Then they get bigger, like children. After that, they become teenagers. Finally, they become adults. As people get older, their bodies change. They can't run as fast as they used to. They might need glasses to see. Their hair can turn gray or fall out. This is called aging. Aging happens to everyone. It's a part of life. But some people age faster than others. This could be because of their genes or how they live.",1.4,98.01,1.6,5.9,3.74,2.5,2.4,2.1875

People grow older over time. As they age, their bodies change. Older people might have gray or white hair. Their skin may have wrinkles, like small lines. Time can make their bones feel weaker. They might not run as fast as when they were young. Older people can't see or hear as well either. They might use glasses or hearing aids. Time also makes people wiser. They learn many things through life.",1.5,97.6,1.9,5.9,4.01,2.91,2.49,2.1875

Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?"" But the owl says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose. Maybe it is her egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, ""Is this your egg?"" But the goose says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the two ducks. Maybe it is their egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the two ducks. They ask the two ducks, ""Is this your egg?"" But the two ducks say, ""No, that is not our egg."" Then the egg breaks.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.

They start as babies. They grow bigger. Then they become kids. They play and learn. They become teens. They become adults. They work and have families. Then they become older adults.
