Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Human aging, the progressive physiological decline that occurs over time in humans, is a complex biological process studied by gerontologists and other scientists. First recognized by ancient civilizations, human aging was initially explained through mythological and philosophical lenses. In the 17th century, the term ""gerontology"" was coined by Belgian mathematician John Bernoulli to describe the study of aging. Today, human aging is understood to involve numerous interconnected mechanisms, including cellular senescence and genomic instability, with significant implications for overall health and lifespan.",15.2,35.2,18.4,16.6,17.57,14.16,7.2,18.0

Human aging, a complex biological process, is the study of the changes in living organisms over time.

Gerontologists, including biologists, physicians, and social scientists, explore the fundamental mechanisms of aging and seek to understand and mitigate its effects, aiming to improve the quality of life for the elderly and aging population.",16.0,32.97,19.1,17.0,18.17,13.88,7.45,18.0

Human aging is a complex biological process that affects all living organisms, including humans. It is characterized by a progressive decline in physiological function and an increased susceptibility to diseases. The study of human aging, known as gerontology, aims to understand the mechanisms behind this process and develop interventions to extend healthy lifespan. This interdisciplinary field draws on knowledge from biology, medicine, psychology, and sociology. While some theories suggest that aging is an inevitable consequence of cellular damage and the depletion of certain resources, others propose that it is a programmed process governed by genetic factors.",14.9,35.81,17.7,15.9,16.78,13.81,7.06,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities.

It's a complex process involving both chronological and biological aging. Human aging is studied by gerontologists, biologists, and physicians. Theories include cellular senescence and the free radical theory. Aging is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and is characterized by a progressive loss of physiological function and increased risk of disease. It's a universal process, yet varies among individuals.",14.4,37.13,17.0,16.0,16.65,13.64,6.88,18.0

Human aging, a multifaceted process of progressive physiological deterioration, is the study of gerontology. This scientific discipline, first systematically explored by the French naturalist René Antoine de Réaumur in the 18th century, investigates the complex interplay of intrinsic and extrinsic factors that contribute to the aging of Homo sapiens. Intrinsic factors, such as genetic predispositions and molecular changes like telomere shortening, are inherent to the human condition. Extrinsic factors, on the other hand, encompass lifestyle choices like diet, exercise, and exposure to environmental stressors, which can significantly influence the aging process. Additionally, stochastic factors, including random molecular damage and cellular dysfunction, play a role in determining the trajectory of human aging. Gerontologists strive to unravel these complex contributors, aiming to enhance our understanding and potentially intervene in the aging process.",15.2,35.0,18.7,17.1,18.14,14.57,7.3,18.0

This includes researching the effects of aging on various systems and organs, as well as the impact on cognitive function and overall well-being.
