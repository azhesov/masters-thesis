Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process that affects the entire body. It is characterized by a decline in physical and cognitive functions, and an increased risk of age-related diseases. The aging process is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including lifestyle choices, exposure to toxins, and medical conditions. As we age, our cells undergo changes that affect their ability to function properly, leading to a decline in tissue and organ function. This can result in a range of age-related symptoms, including wrinkles, gray hair, and decreased mobility. Ultimately, human aging is a natural process that is shaped by a combination of factors, and it is influenced by a complex interplay of biological, psychological, and social factors.
