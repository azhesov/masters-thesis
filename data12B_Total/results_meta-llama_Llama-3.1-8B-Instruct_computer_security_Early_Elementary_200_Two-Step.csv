Computer security is the practice of preventing, detecting, and responding to unauthorized access to, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of computer systems and data. It involves the protection of hardware, software, and data from various threats and vulnerabilities. Computer security is essential in today's digital age, where computer systems and data are increasingly being targeted by cybercriminals, hackers, and other malicious actors.

There are several types of computer security threats, including malware, viruses, Trojan horses, spyware, adware, ransomware, and phishing. These threats can compromise the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems and data. To prevent these threats, computer security measures such as firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, antivirus software, encryption, and access controls are employed.

Computer security is also concerned with ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. This is achieved through data backup and recovery, data encryption, and access controls.
