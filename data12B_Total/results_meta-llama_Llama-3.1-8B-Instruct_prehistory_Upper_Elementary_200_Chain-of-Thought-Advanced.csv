Prehistory is a time long ago. Before people had written words, it was hard to know what happened. Archaeologists find clues like old bones, tools, and other things to tell us about it. They dig in the dirt to find these things. They also study the earth and rocks to learn about the past. By putting the clues together, they can tell us what life was like a long time ago. People lived in small groups and hunted for food. They made tools from rocks and wood. They also made shelters from branches and animal hides.

The final answer is: There is no final numerical answer for this problem. The problem is asking to write a paragraph in a specific style and at a specific level. The paragraph is: Prehistory is a time long ago. Before people had written words, it was hard to know what happened.

Others were nomads, and they moved from place to place. People from prehistory were very good at making things with their hands. They made clothes, jewelry, and pottery. They also made pictures on walls and in caves. These pictures showed animals and people. They were very good at drawing. People from prehistory left behind many things that we can still find today. We can learn about their lives by studying these things. They are like a big puzzle that we are still trying to figure out. The more we learn, the more we understand about people from prehistory.

They made tools from rocks and sticks. They built homes from sticks and mud. They hunted animals for food and made clothes from animal hides. They drew pictures on walls and rocks to tell stories. These pictures show us what they looked like and what they did. Some of the pictures are of animals, some are of people, and some are of things they hunted.

The final answer is: 
Long, long ago, people lived on earth. But before that, earth was very different. It was hot and no life could live there. Then, after a long time, the earth started to cool. Slowly, life began to appear. First, there were only tiny living things. These tiny things grew and changed. Then, more and more complex things appeared. People, or humans, were one of these complex things. They lived in small groups and hunted for food. As time went by, people learned new things and made new tools. They built shelters and protected themselves from the elements. People kept growing and changing. They moved to different places and formed bigger groups.

Here is the final answer:
Prehistory is a time before written records. People made tools from rocks and wood. They hunted animals and gathered fruits and vegetables. Some people lived in small groups and moved from place to place. Others built homes in one spot. They made clothing from animal skins and furs. They also made art on rocks and in the ground. Many people died young, and not many people lived to be old. The people of prehistory are not famous like kings and queens. We only know what they did because of the things they left behind. These things are like tools, homes, and art. We can learn a lot about people of prehistory by looking at these things. This is what makes prehistory interesting.

These can show us what people looked like, what they wore, and what they believed in. It is like putting together a puzzle to learn about prehistory.

Here's an example solution to the above problem:


## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' in 200 words.
To explain 'prehistory' in a way that a 5th-grade student can understand, I would focus on the time period before written records were kept. This time period is called prehistory because it happened before people started writing down their stories and events. Imagine your family has been living in the same place for many years. Your grandparents might tell you stories about your great-grandparents, but before that, there are no written records. That's what prehistory is like. It's the time before people started keeping written records, so we can't read about it in books like we can with history.
