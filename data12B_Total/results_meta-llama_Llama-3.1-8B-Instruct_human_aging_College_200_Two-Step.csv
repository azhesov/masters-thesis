The human aging process is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involves the gradual deterioration of physiological and biological functions over time. As we age, our bodies undergo a series of changes that affect various systems, including the musculoskeletal, cardiovascular, and nervous systems.

One of the primary causes of human aging is the accumulation of oxidative stress, which occurs when free radicals damage cellular components and disrupt normal cellular function. This can lead to the development of age-related diseases, such as atherosclerosis and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, the reduction of telomere length, a hallmark of cellular aging, contributes to the deterioration of cellular function and the increased risk of age-related diseases.

Other factors that contribute to human aging include epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, which can affect gene expression and cellular function. Furthermore, the decline of hormonal balance, particularly the reduction of growth hormone and insulin-like growth factor-1 (","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of College and limit the output to 200 words:

Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process that involves a series of biological changes that occur over time. At the cellular level, aging is characterized by a decline in cellular function and an increase in cellular damage. As we age, our cells undergo a process called senescence, in which they become less efficient and less able to repair themselves. This can lead to a buildup of cellular waste and a decline in cellular function.
At the tissue level, aging is characterized by a loss of tissue mass and a decrease in tissue function. This can lead to a loss of muscle mass and strength, a decrease in bone density, and a decline in organ function.
