Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

The term 'astronomy' originates from the Greek word 'astron' meaning'star', and 'nomos' meaning 'law'. It is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere. Astronomy involves physics, mathematics, and chemistry, and it is a fundamental science that helps us understand the universe. Astronomers observe and analyze celestial bodies and their interactions, seeking to understand their composition, origin, and evolution. They use various techniques, including spectroscopy, photometry, and interferometry, to gather data about distant objects. By studying the cosmos, astronomers can help us understand our place in the universe and the fundamental laws that govern it.",14.5,36.93,17.7,16.6,16.76,14.22,7.09,19.25

The history and practice of astronomy are as old as the human race, with roots stretching back to the earliest civilizations. From the ancient Egyptians who used it to predict Nile floods, to the modern astronomers who study the farthest reaches of the universe, this science has captivated the human imagination. Today, astronomy is a complex, multidisciplinary field that incorporates physics, mathematics, and computer science. It involves observing and interpreting the cosmos, from the smallest particles to the largest galaxies, using advanced technologies such as telescopes and space probes.

Astronomy, much like debugging, involves various aspects, including stargazing, celestial mechanics, astrophysics, cosmology, and astrobiology. It is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. Throughout history, astronomers have developed numerous tools and techniques to observe and understand the universe, from simple sundials to powerful telescopes. Some famous astronomers include Galileo Galilei, who improved the telescope and supported the heliocentric model of the solar system, and Edwin Hubble, who discovered the expanding universe and is honored with a space telescope named after him.

Key figures like Ptolemy, Copernicus, Galileo, and Kepler have significantly contributed to our understanding of the cosmos. Their groundbreaking theories and discoveries, often made with rudimentary instruments, laid the foundation for our current knowledge of astronomy.

Cosmic exploration, commonly known as astronomy, is the scientific study of celestial objects, spaces, and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It involves various aspects such as observing and analyzing the universe's physical and chemical properties, understanding the evolution of stars and galaxies, and investigating the origins and evolution of the universe itself. Astronomy employs a multitude of techniques, including spectroscopy, photometry, and interferometry, to gather data about the cosmos. It also involves mathematical modeling and theoretical physics to interpret this data and make predictions about the universe's behavior. The history of astronomy dates back to ancient civilizations, with early astronomers such as the Babylonians, Greeks, and Chinese making significant contributions. However, modern astronomy as we know it emerged during the Scientific Revolution in the 16th century, with figures like Nicolaus Copernicus and Galileo Galilei making groundbreaking observations and theories. Today, astronomy is a thriving",15.7,28.47,18.0,17.4,17.84,14.74,7.24,19.25

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system.

The history of astronomy, the study of celestial objects and phenomena, is intertwined with the history of humanity. From ancient civilizations that developed intricate calendars and tracked the movements of the stars, to the present day where we explore the farthest reaches of the universe with powerful telescopes, astronomy has captivated the human imagination. The advent of the telescope in the early 17th century revolutionized astronomy, allowing us to observe the heavens in unprecedented detail. However, the practice of astronomy predates this invention by centuries, with ancient Greeks like Ptolemy and Hipparchus making significant contributions to our understanding of the cosmos. Today, astronomy is a multifaceted field that encompasses astrophysics, planetary science, and cosmology, among other disciplines. It continues to push the boundaries of human knowledge, revealing the wonders of the universe one celestial body at a time.",15.2,35.0,18.5,17.4,17.97,14.22,7.49,19.25

Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere, encompasses numerous aspects. It involves the observation and analysis of stars, galaxies, planets, and other celestial bodies, as well as the physical laws and forces that govern their motion and behavior. Astronomy is intertwined with physics, mathematics, and chemistry, requiring advanced knowledge of these disciplines for comprehensive understanding. The field of astronomy has significantly evolved over centuries, from ancient civilizations' astrological practices to modern space exploration and high-tech telescopes, continually expanding our understanding of the universe's vastness and mysteries.",16.2,27.05,18.8,17.5,18.22,14.86,7.41,19.25
