As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Jamie: ""Oh, like how we lock them up when we're not using them? Is that what you mean?""
Emily: ""Exactly! But there's more to it. We also need to make sure our passwords are strong, like a secret code that's hard to guess. And we should never share our passwords with anyone, not even our best friends.""
Jamie: ""Wow, that makes sense. I've heard about hackers who try to break into computers. Is that what you're talking about?""

Computer security is like a secret club where only certain people are allowed in. It's like when Johnson wanted to go to the meetings, but only men were allowed. In computer security, there are rules to keep bad guys out. These rules are like questions that Johnson asked, like ""how"" and ""why"". Computers need to be safe, just like Ruth and Naomi needed to be safe on their journey. We protect computers with strong passwords, like Boaz's fields were protected by his busy servants.

There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Computer security is like protecting a secret. Imagine you have a secret message that only you and your friend know about. You wouldn't want anyone else to read it, right? That's what computer security does. It's like a secret code that keeps bad guys from looking at your personal information on your computer. Just like Johnson asked questions to learn more about math, computer security asks questions to make sure it's only you using your computer. It checks if you know the secret password, or if you have a special key. If you don't, it won't let you in. That's how computer security keeps your secrets safe, just like Naomi and Ruth kept each other company on their journey.",6.9,72.87,8.1,9.9,8.49,8.0,4.09,7.142857142857142
