Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 150 words. Prehistory refers to the period before written records. It's divided into three eras: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Stone Age began around 3.3 million years ago with the first use of stone tools by hominids. It's further divided into Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). The Bronze Age (around 3300 BCE) saw the development of metallurgy, while the Iron Age (around 1200 BCE) marked the widespread use of iron tools. Prehistory ended with the invention of writing, which varied by region, ranging from around 3400 BCE in Mesopotamia to the 17th century in some parts of the Americas.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of College and limit the output to 150 words:

Revised Text:

Prehistory encompasses the era before written records, spanning from approximately 2.1 million years ago with Homo habilis until around 3200 BCE to 1000 BCE, depending on the region. This period is often segmented based on technological progress: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Major developments include tool-making, fire control, agriculture, and societal complexity. Due to the absence of written records, our knowledge of prehistory primarily comes from archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology. While understanding is limited, prehistory offers crucial insights into human evolution, migration, and cultural-technological development.",13.0,30.16,14.3,14.1,11.87,15.37,5.1,8.142857142857142
