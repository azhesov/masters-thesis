As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Computer security is like a strong, smart guard for our computers. Just like Johnson stood out by asking questions, computer security asks questions too, but to computers. It asks, ""Are you who you say you are?"" and ""Should you be doing that?"" If the answers are wrong, the security guard says, ""No way!"" and stops the computer from doing bad things. It's like the men at NASA relying on Johnson for the right answers. Without computer security, harmful activities could sneak in, just like Ruth gathering unnoticed grain.

You could say: ""To keep your computer safe, you should ask questions like 'Who can see my files?' and 'How can I lock my computer?' Asking questions helps you understand 'whys' and 'hows' of computer security, just like Katherine Johnson wanted to know the 'hows' and 'whys' of math problems.

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

When people use computers, they should protect them from bad people. These bad people might try to steal important information or make the computer stop working. This is called computer security. To keep their computers safe, people should use strong passwords, update their software, and never open messages from people they don't know. By doing these things, people can keep their computers secure, just like how Johnson kept her ideas safe by asking questions and working hard.",7.2,72.16,8.8,9.9,8.81,8.81,4.29,7.142857142857142

In this context, ""computer security"" is defined as the protection of computers and their networks from threats, damage, or unauthorized access.

Computer security is like a fortress protecting our computers. Just like Johnson asked questions to understand math problems, we must ask questions to understand computer security. Who might try to harm our computers? How can we stop them? Why is it important to protect our computers? By asking these questions, we can build a strong fortress with passwords, updates, and careful browsing to keep our computers safe.",6.9,72.87,8.6,10.4,8.65,8.69,4.2,7.142857142857142
