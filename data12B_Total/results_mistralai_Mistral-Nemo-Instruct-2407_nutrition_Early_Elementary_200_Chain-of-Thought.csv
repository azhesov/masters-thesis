Nutrition is like fuel for our bodies. Just like cars need gas to run, we need food to give us energy. But not just any food will do. We need healthy food to stay strong and healthy. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins are all part of a nutritious diet. These foods have the vitamins and minerals our bodies need to grow and function properly. Think of it like a puzzle. Each piece of food we eat has a part to play in keeping our bodies healthy and happy. That's why it's important to eat a variety of foods every day. So, the next time you're feeling hungry, remember that you're not just eating to fill your tummy, you're feeding your body the nutrition it needs to thrive.",5.9,75.5,6.8,9.6,8.43,7.82,4.03,5.666666666666667
