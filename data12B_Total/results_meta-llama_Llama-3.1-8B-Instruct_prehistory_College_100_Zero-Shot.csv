The prehistoric period refers to the time before recorded history. It spans from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing systems, around 5,000 years ago. During this era, early humans developed tools, hunted, and gathered. As populations grew, so did the complexity of societies, leading to the emergence of complex cultures, and eventually, the rise of civilizations. The prehistoric period is divided into several stages, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras, each characterized by distinct technological and social developments. These periods laid the groundwork for the modern world.  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --  --",11.0,40.75,16.4,13.2,13.15,14.84,5.76,10.571428571428571

Prehistory is the period of human history before written records existed. It spans from the emergence of the first hominins, such as Homo habilis, around 2.8 million years ago, to the advent of writing, which occurred independently in various civilizations around 5,000 years ago. During this time, humans developed complex societies, tools, and technologies that enabled them to adapt to their environments and exploit new resources. Archaeologists study prehistory by analyzing artifacts, such as stone tools, pottery, and other material remains, to reconstruct the lives and cultures of our ancient ancestors. Their findings provide valuable insights into human evolution and the development of modern societies.
