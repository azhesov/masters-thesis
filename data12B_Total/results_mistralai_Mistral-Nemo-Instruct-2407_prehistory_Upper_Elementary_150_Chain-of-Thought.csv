Prehistory is like the very beginning of time, even before the first written records. It's the story of our ancestors who didn't leave behind books or letters. Instead, they told their tales through cave paintings, tools, and fossils. Imagine you're in a cave, and on the walls, you see animals and people drawn with charcoal or paint. Those are pieces of prehistory! Scientists study these artifacts to learn about how our earliest ancestors lived. For example, the famous Lascaux Caves in France have paintings over 17,000 years old. They show that even back then, people were artists, hunters, and storytellers. Prehistory is like a big puzzle. Each artifact is a piece that helps us understand our past.",6.7,68.06,8.4,10.0,8.34,9.9,3.91,6.5

Prehistory is the time period before written records were kept. This means we don't have books or newspapers from that time to tell us what happened. Instead, we learn about prehistory by studying things like fossils, cave paintings, and tools made by early humans. These artifacts help us understand how people lived thousands of years ago. One of the most important things we've learned is that early humans were hunters and gatherers. They moved around a lot, following herds of animals and picking fruits and vegetables as they found them. Another key point is that these early humans were not as advanced as we are today. They didn't have cars, computers, or even fire. Instead, they used simple tools made from stone or wood. Over time, however, they learned how to control fire, which helped them cook food and stay warm. This was a big step in human",5.9,75.4,7.6,9.5,7.87,8.74,3.82,6.5

Prehistory is like the big, long story of Earth and all its life before people started writing things down. It's like when you're playing with your toys and you're making up a story, but nobody is writing it down. Instead, we look at things like fossils, which are like really old bones and footprints, to tell us what happened. Scientists also study rocks and other things to find out about prehistory. It's like a giant puzzle where we try to put the pieces together to understand what life was like a long, long time ago.",7.1,72.46,8.4,9.4,7.98,8.52,3.9,7.142857142857142

Prehistory is like a big, long story about our planet and the people who lived here before we had things like books or writing. It's like trying to figure out a puzzle without all the pieces. Scientists and archaeologists look for clues like old tools, pictures on cave walls, and bones of animals and people. They use these clues to guess how people lived, what they ate, and what their lives were like. It's a bit like reading a mystery story where you have to figure out what happened by looking for hidden messages. But don't worry, even though it's called 'prehistory', we still know a lot about the people who came before us. We just have to use our imagination and think like a detective!",7.0,72.56,8.6,9.1,8.57,8.81,4.19,7.428571428571429
