Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

The term ""astronomy"" in this context refers to the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere.

Astronomy, the scientific exploration of celestial objects and phenomena beyond Earth's atmosphere, is a complex and intriguing field. It involves numerous aspects, including stellar classification, astrobiology, dark matter, exoplanet research, and the behavior of black holes. Astronomy tends to be more challenging when various celestial bodies interact, as changes in one can affect another. The term ""astronomy"" is derived from the Greek words 'astron' meaning'star' and 'nomos' meaning 'law', reflecting the field's focus on understanding the laws governing celestial bodies.",15.1,35.41,18.4,17.4,17.51,14.22,7.24,19.25

The term ""bug"" can be used, but it should be used as it is in the first example, referring to a defect in software, not an insect.

Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena, is a vast and intricate field. It involves numerous subsystems, such as physics, mathematics, and computer modeling, which can be tightly coupled, making debugging, the process of finding and resolving defects, particularly challenging. Astronomy's complexity necessitates tools like telescopes, satellites, and supercomputers. These tools often rely on software, which can contain bugs that hinder correct operation. For instance, a bug in a data analysis program could skew results, leading to incorrect interpretations of astronomical observations. Therefore, debugging in astronomy is a critical process, requiring expertise in both astronomy and software development.",14.5,36.93,17.5,16.8,17.05,13.99,7.02,19.25

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

From the ancient times, astronomy has been a subject of immense fascination. It involves the study of celestial objects, their positions, and movements in the cosmos. Astronomy is an interdisciplinary field, drawing from physics, mathematics, and chemistry. It encompasses a vast array of phenomena, from the tiniest subatomic particles to the vast cosmic microwave background radiation. Astronomy has played a pivotal role in shaping human understanding of the universe, guiding navigation, and inspiring philosophical and religious thought. Today, astronomers use advanced technologies like space telescopes and radio telescopes to observe the cosmos, unraveling its mysteries and pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.",14.5,36.93,17.6,16.4,17.07,14.28,7.25,19.25

It involves a multitude of aspects, including astrophysics, cosmology, and astrobiology. Telescopes, both ground-based and space-based, are instrumental in this endeavor, providing invaluable data for analysis. Stars, galaxies, and black holes are among the myriad subjects of interest.
