As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'astronomy' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 100 words. Since 'astronomy' is a field of science that studies celestial objects and phenomena, it is likely that the target reader may not have a deep understanding of the term. Therefore, the paragraph should aim to introduce astronomy in a simple, engaging, and accessible way, using the structure of 'asking questions' and 'discovering answers', similar to the examples provided. The paragraph should also incorporate the word'stars'.

When the night sky is clear, little dots of light twinkle back at us. Have you ever wondered what those lights are? They are called stars! Just like Johnson wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys"" of math, astronomers ask questions about these stars. They want to know how far away they are, how big they are, and why they shine so brightly. By asking these questions and looking through special telescopes, astronomers have discovered many amazing things about stars. They have even found out that some stars are so big,",7.2,72.16,8.9,9.7,9.06,8.81,4.4,7.142857142857142

Astronomers study stars in space. They ask questions like, ""How are stars born?"" and ""How do they die?"" They use big telescopes to see far away stars. Some stars are big, some are small. Some are white, some are red. Astronomers learn about stars by watching them twinkle in the night sky. They also look at pictures from space telescopes.

When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went.

She found out that stars were huge balls of fire and that they were so far away because of the vastness of space.
