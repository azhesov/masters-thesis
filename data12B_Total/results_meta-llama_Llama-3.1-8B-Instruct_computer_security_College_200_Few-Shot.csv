Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war.

Computer security, or information security, is a posture taken by individuals, organizations, and countries to protect digital information from unauthorized access, use, or destruction. This stance involves the implementation of measures to safeguard sensitive data, systems, and networks from cyber threats. The goal of computer security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital information, while maintaining readiness to counter with force any incursions from malicious actors. Armed with advanced security protocols and threat intelligence, individuals and organizations can defend themselves against the ever-evolving landscape of cyber threats, from hacking and malware to data breaches and identity theft. By taking a proactive approach to computer security, individuals and organizations can maintain their digital sovereignty, protect their digital assets, and ensure business continuity in the face of cyber threats. Effective computer security is a critical component of digital citizenship, enabling individuals and organizations to safely navigate the digital world. It is a posture of preparedness, not just a reactive measure.  (186 words)

Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war.

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Network security, also known as computer security, is a term used in the field of cybersecurity that refers to the practice of protecting computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, misuse, or damage. It involves the implementation of various measures to safeguard the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Network security is a critical aspect of information technology, as it protects sensitive information and prevents potential threats from compromising the security of the system. The underlying goal of network security is to prevent malicious attacks from disrupting or destroying the system. It involves the use of firewalls, intrusion detection and prevention systems, and encryption methods to protect against cyber threats. The posture of a network in terms of security is often referred to as ""armed neutrality,"" where it is prepared to defend itself against any potential threats without making any alliances with malicious actors. This posture is essential for maintaining the security and integrity of the network and its data.

The computer security posture, an approach that neither takes sides in the digital world nor allies with malicious actors, is termed as ""digital neutrality."" This term signifies a state of being prepared to defend against all types of cyber threats and maintaining a strong stance against any malicious activity. 
In essence, digital neutrality is a condition where a system, individual, or organization asserts that it will safeguard its digital assets against any potential cyber attacks from all parties. 
This approach is often seen in cybersecurity policies, where an organization declares its readiness to counter any type of digital incursion or invasion.
