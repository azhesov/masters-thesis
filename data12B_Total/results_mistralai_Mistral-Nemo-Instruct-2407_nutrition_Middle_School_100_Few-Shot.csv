In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?'

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 100 words. In this case, we are discussing fruits and vegetables.

Fruits and veggies, our nutritional friends, come in many colors and sizes. They grow in gardens and farms, just like the beans in our first story. Instead of a fire, we cook them with heat and water. Inside, they hold vitamins and minerals, essential for our bodies' growth and health. Without them, we'd be as lost as the straw in the first example, not knowing what to do for a better fate. So, let's embrace these nutritious allies and enjoy them daily, just as we should have listened to the bean's tale.",7.9,75.64,9.6,8.8,9.88,7.08,4.74,11.0

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 100 words. In the body of the paragraph, include the phrase ""Nutrition is the process"".

Nutrition is the process by which our body gets the energy and nutrients it needs from the food we eat. It begins when we chew our food and it mixes with saliva. Then, as it travels through our digestive system, it breaks down into smaller parts that our body can absorb and use. Just like the beans in the story, food provides us with essential building blocks for growth and health. Without proper nutrition, our body would not function as it should, much like how the engine room in the second example would not run without fuel.",8.4,74.32,10.2,9.1,10.29,7.14,4.91,11.0

Food is the fuel our body needs to grow, work, and think. When we eat, our body uses the food's nutrition to stay strong and active. The brain, our body's control center, also needs this nutrition to think and learn. So, eating the right foods is important for our overall health.",8.1,75.24,9.8,8.8,9.72,7.02,4.7,11.0
