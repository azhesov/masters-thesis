Prehistory refers to the period of time before written records existed. It began when the first humans appeared on Earth and lasted until the development of writing, which happened around 5,000 years ago. During this time, humans lived in small groups, hunted for food, and gathered fruits and vegetables. They also made tools from stones, wood, and bones. As people traveled and traded with one another, new tools and ideas were shared, leading to the development of more complex societies.
Over time, people began to domesticate animals, such as dogs and sheep, which provided them with a steady food source. This led to the development of agriculture, which allowed for the growth of cities and the emergence of civilizations. Prehistory is a fascinating period in human history, full of discoveries and achievements that paved the way for the modern world we live in today. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the early lives of humans and how they adapted",9.3,55.74,10.7,11.5,10.29,11.6,4.87,6.75

The earliest humans roamed the Earth long ago. These early people were called prehistoric humans. They lived before written records were kept. As a result, we know very little about their lives. However, archaeologists study artifacts, such as tools and homes, to learn about their daily lives. They discovered that prehistoric humans were skilled hunters and gatherers. They used stones and sticks to hunt for food and build shelters. Prehistoric humans also made jewelry and other decorations from stones and bones.

Some prehistoric humans lived in small groups, while others lived in large tribes. They communicated with each other using gestures and sounds. These early people likely had their own languages, but we do not know what they sounded like. Prehistoric humans left behind many mysteries, but archaeologists continue to uncover clues about their lives. By studying their artifacts and remains, we can gain a better understanding of how they lived and what they accomplished. Prehistoric humans may be",7.5,60.41,9.7,10.6,8.9,12.33,4.0,5.090909090909091

I still remember the summer I spent at the dig site, surrounded by the dusty remnants of a long-lost civilization. My grandfather, a renowned archaeologist, had taken me on a journey through time, and I was determined to uncover the secrets of prehistory. As I carefully brushed away the dirt from a weathered stone, I felt the thrill of discovery coursing through my veins. The air was thick with the scent of ancient earth and the sound of birds chirping in the distance. It was as if the very spirits of the past were whispering their stories to me.

Prehistory, to me, is more than just a series of dates and events â€“ it's a tapestry woven from the threads of human experience. It's the story of our ancestors, who built shelters from the elements, hunted for food, and told tales around campfires. Their lives were marked by hardship and perseverance, but also by",8.6,63.09,9.8,11.9,11.67,9.8,5.16,8.857142857142858

Prehistory is the time before written records existed. It began when humans first appeared on Earth and ended around 5,000 years ago, when writing was invented. During prehistory, people lived in small groups, hunted for food, and gathered fruits and vegetables. They made tools from stone, wood, and bone. As time passed, people learned to farm and domesticate animals, which led to the growth of villages and towns. Early humans developed complex societies with leaders and social hierarchies. They also created art, such as cave paintings and carvings, which give us clues about their lives and cultures. Prehistory is often divided into three periods: the Paleolithic Era, the Mesolithic Era, and the Neolithic Era. Each period represents a significant change in human society and technology. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the early days of human civilization and how our ancestors lived, hunted, and survived in a world without modern technology.

Prehistory is the time before written records. It started about 2.5 million years ago when humans first appeared on Earth. During this time, early humans learned to control fire, hunt for food, and make tools from stones and bones. They also began to live in groups and create shelters. As time went on, humans developed new skills, such as farming and making pottery. Around 10,000 years ago, people started to settle in one place, building homes and creating communities. The Neolithic period, which lasted from around 10,000 to 4,000 years ago, saw the development of more complex societies, including the construction of large buildings and the use of metal tools. The Bronze Age, which began around 3,500 BCE, marked the beginning of written records. This marked the end of prehistory and the start of recorded history.

Prehistory
Prehistory refers to the time period before humans developed written records. This means that people who lived before writing existed did not leave behind written documents like books or newspapers. Instead, archaeologists, who study old artifacts, must look for other clues to learn about the past. They search for things like tools, buildings, and other remains that people left behind. By studying these clues, archaeologists can piece together a picture of what life was like in the past. 

Some of the clues that archaeologists look for include:

* Tools made from stone, bone, or wood
* Buildings made from stone, mud, or branches
* Artifacts like pottery, jewelry, or carvings
* Remains of food, like old bones or seeds
* Marks left on cave walls or rock faces

By studying these clues, archaeologists can learn about the people who lived before written records existed. They can find out what",8.7,62.78,12.1,11.6,10.07,12.18,4.49,7.375

Prehistory refers to the time period before written records existed. During this time, people lived in different ways. Some were hunter-gatherers, who traveled to find food and shelter. They used simple stone tools, like knives and axes, to hunt and gather food. Others were farmers, who grew crops and raised animals. They built homes from natural materials, like mud and branches. Some people were herders, who took care of animals, like sheep and goats. These early humans developed skills and knowledge that helped them survive. They learned how to hunt, gather, and farm, and how",9.1,56.45,12.6,11.9,10.58,13.33,4.77,14.2

Prehistory is a long time ago, even before written records existed. It was the time when humans and animals lived on Earth. Humans did not have houses, cars, or computers like we do today. They had to find food and shelter in the wild. People from prehistory were hunters and gatherers, which means they hunted animals for food and picked fruits and vegetables from the wild.

Some people from prehistory were nomads, which means they moved from place to place in search of food and water. They left behind clues like rocks, bones, and footprints that help us learn about their lives. Archaeologists are scientists who study these clues to understand how people lived in prehistory. They can tell us what people ate, where they lived, and how they survived in a world without modern technology. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the lives of our ancestors and how they helped shape the world we live in today.

Prehistory is a time period that began 2.5 million years ago and ended 3,500 years ago. During this time, humans and their ancestors, such as Neanderthals and Homo sapiens, lived on Earth without any written records. Instead, they left behind artifacts like tools, paintings, and carvings that tell us about their lives. These early humans had to adapt to their environments and find ways to survive, which is why they developed different tools for hunting, gathering, and farming. The discovery of fire, the creation of the wheel, and the development of language were all significant milestones in prehistory. As humans migrated and settled in new places, they began to form communities and develop cultures.
