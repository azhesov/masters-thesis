As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 50 words. Here is the question: ""What can we learn from nutrition?"" 

Here is a possible answer: As we work on our health, we want to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys."" By eating a balanced diet, we begin to stand out. We can learn from the teams of scientists who study nutrition. They tell us what to eat and why. We become stronger and healthier, and the experts rely on us to have the answers they need.  ​
 
Explanation: This paragraph mirrors the structure and vocabulary from the given examples. The first sentence asks a question, just like example 1. The second sentence uses the phrase ""begin to stand out,"" which is used in example 1. The third sentence uses the phrase ""learn from the teams,"" which is similar to ""learn more about the projects"" in example 1. The fourth sentence mirrors the ""increasingly relied on her to have the answers"" from example 1. The fifth sentence mirrors the",6.8,73.07,7.8,9.5,8.09,7.71,3.97,7.142857142857142

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 50 words. 

Nutritionists recommend eating food that's not only delicious, but also nutritious. People need nutrients to stay healthy. They must get enough protein, vitamins, and minerals. Foods with these nutrients help build and fix the body. Healthy eating is easy – just eat a variety of foods, like fruits and veggies!

The length of the paragraph is limited to 50 words. The paragraph does not contain the 'why' or 'how' questions, but it follows the same structure of stating a fact and then explaining it.

Example 3:
Proper nutrition is essential for a healthy body. A balanced diet should consist of a variety of foods. These include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. A well-rounded diet will provide the necessary energy and nutrients for optimal health. A diet lacking these essential foods can lead to health problems.

In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Nutrition is what we need to keep our bodies strong. We need foods that give us energy to run, eat, and play. Fruits and vegetables are full of vitamins and minerals. They make our bodies healthy and grow strong. We should eat a variety of foods every day to get the nutrition our bodies need.  In the process, we will have the energy we need to do all the things we love to do!  With good nutrition, we can be healthy and strong.

Here is a short paragraph about 'nutrition':
Our bodies need good nutrition to stay healthy. Foods like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains give us the energy we need. They also help us grow strong and keep our minds sharp. We need to eat a variety of foods to get all the nutrients our bodies need to stay healthy and strong.  ""Let's go to the grocery store and buy some healthy snacks, like apples and carrots."" said Mom. ""Great idea, Mom!"" said me.  We went to the store and bought some healthy food to make our bodies strong. 

Here are some specific feedbacks I'd like to give you on your writing.

-   The sentence structure is too simple. For example, ""Our bodies need good nutrition to stay healthy"" could be rewritten as ""Good nutrition is essential for maintaining a healthy body"".
-   There is a lack of variety in sentence structure. Most of the sentences are simple statements. 
-   You could add more descriptive",5.5,81.93,7.8,9.4,8.3,7.88,3.99,7.142857142857142
