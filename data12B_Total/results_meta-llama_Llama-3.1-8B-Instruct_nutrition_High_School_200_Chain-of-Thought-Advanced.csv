Nutrition is the study of how the body uses food. It looks at how nutrients from food help our bodies grow, repair tissues, and work properly. There are six main categories of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. Carbohydrates give us energy, proteins help build and repair tissues, fats help keep us warm and give us energy, vitamins and minerals help our bodies work properly, and water helps keep our bodies healthy. A good diet provides the right balance of these nutrients for our bodies to function properly. If we eat too much of one type of nutrient, it can cause problems. For example, eating too much sugar can lead to health problems like obesity and diabetes. On the other hand, not eating enough of certain nutrients can cause health problems like anemia and osteoporosis.
