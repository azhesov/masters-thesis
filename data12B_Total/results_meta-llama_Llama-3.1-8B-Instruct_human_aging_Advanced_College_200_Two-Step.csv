Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. The process of human aging refers to the gradual decline in physical, mental, and biological functions that occur as people grow older. This process begins from the moment of birth and continues until death. The rate of aging varies among individuals, influenced by factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental conditions. As humans age, their cells undergo changes that can lead to the development of age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, the aging process can cause changes in the body's ability to maintain homeostasis, leading to a decline in physical function and mobility. Theories of aging, such as the free radical theory and the telomere shortening theory, attempt to explain the underlying mechanisms of aging. However, the exact causes of human aging remain poorly understood, and research continues to explore the complex relationships between genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors that contribute to the aging process.

Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process that involves the gradual decline of physical and cognitive functions. Telomere length, oxidative stress, and epigenetic changes are key contributors to this process. Telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular senescence and death. Oxidative stress, resulting from an imbalance between the production of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and the body's ability to neutralize them, causes damage to DNA, proteins, and lipids, leading to cellular dysfunction. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modification, affect gene expression, leading to changes in cellular behavior and function. These changes accumulate over time, contributing to the aging process. Additionally, telomere shortening and oxidative stress can trigger epigenetic changes, creating a feedback loop that accelerates aging.
