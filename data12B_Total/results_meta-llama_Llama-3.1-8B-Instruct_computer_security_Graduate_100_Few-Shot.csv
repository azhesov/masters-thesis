Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Computer security, or cyber security, is the study of the protection of computer systems and networks from the threat of unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This includes protecting against malware, viruses, and other malicious software. It is a field of study that draws on computer science, mathematics, and engineering, as well as the social sciences. A computer security specialist must consider not only the technical aspects of security but also the human and organizational factors that influence the security of a system. The goal is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data.  Computer security is an evolving field, with new threats and challenges emerging constantly.​

Computer security, or infosec, is the study of protecting information and systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This includes protecting against malware, viruses, trojans, and other types of cyber threats. Computer security is a subset of cybersecurity and is used to protect data, networks, and systems from cyber attacks. It involves various techniques such as encryption, firewalls, access control, and intrusion detection systems. Effective computer security requires a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber threats.

Computer security is the practice of protecting computing assets from theft, damage, or exploitation. This includes ensuring the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of sensitive data. The field of computer security encompasses a wide range of topics, such as cryptography, access control, and network security. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws on principles from computer science, mathematics, and philosophy. Computer security professionals employ various techniques, including threat modeling, risk assessment, and vulnerability management, to identify and mitigate potential security risks. Effective computer security requires a proactive and ongoing approach to protecting against evolving threats. Advanced threats demand sophisticated solutions.​

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other.

Computer security is the study of the protection of computer systems and networks from unauthorized access and cyber attacks. This field of study, also known as cybersecurity, encompasses a range of disciplines, including cryptography, threat analysis, and risk management. Computer security professionals use various techniques and technologies to safeguard computer systems and networks, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption. The goal of computer security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems and data, protecting against threats from hackers, malware, and other cyber threats.

Computer security is the study of safeguarding computer systems from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This field is an interdisciplinary one, drawing on computer science, engineering, and law. Researchers in computer security investigate various aspects of the security of computer systems, including cryptography, network security, and operating system security. They also study the social and psychological factors that contribute to computer security breaches, such as human error and social engineering. By developing new technologies and strategies, computer security professionals work to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of computer systems and data.

Computer security, or infosec, is the study of protecting information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. Computer security involves the application of techniques and methods for protecting computers, networks, and other computer systems from malicious attacks and unauthorized access. This includes the use of firewalls, encryption, and other technologies to prevent hacking and other security breaches. The field of computer security is constantly evolving, with new threats and vulnerabilities emerging all the time, making it a challenging and dynamic field of study. It requires the expertise of computer professionals and experts. 
The concept of computer security has been around since the early days of computing. With the rapid growth of the internet and the increasing dependence on digital technology, computer security has become a critical issue for individuals, businesses, and governments. 
Computer security professionals work to prevent, detect, and respond to security threats. They use a variety of techniques and tools to protect computer systems and networks, and to investigate and mitigate the effects of",14.5,36.83,17.6,17.0,16.96,14.28,6.89,18.0
