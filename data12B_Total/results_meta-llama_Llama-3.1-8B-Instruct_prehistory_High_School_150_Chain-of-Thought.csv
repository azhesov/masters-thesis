The study of prehistory refers to the time before written records existed.  This means that we have to rely on archaeological finds to learn about the lives of people who lived long ago.  People have always been curious about the past, and our understanding of prehistory has grown significantly over the years.  Archaeologists excavate sites to uncover artifacts, which give clues about the way people lived, what they ate, and what they believed.  These artifacts can include tools, pottery, and other objects that have been preserved for thousands of years.  By studying these artifacts and how they were used, archaeologists can reconstruct the lives of people in the past.  This can be a fascinating process, as it can give us insight into the lives of people who lived before the invention of writing.  It can also help us understand how societies developed and changed over time.

Step 4: Read your paragraph and consider if it is clear, concise and engaging for a High School level reader.

Imagine being an archaeologist, digging through the earth to uncover the secrets of the past. The prehistoric period is the time before written records were kept, meaning we have to rely on artifacts and fossils to learn about human history. During this time, humans were hunter-gatherers, living in small groups and moving from place to place to find food and shelter. As the climate changed and populations grew, humans began to develop more complex societies. They created tools, such as the bow and arrow, and started to domesticate animals, like dogs. Eventually, humans developed agriculture, which allowed for more stable communities and the rise of cities. By studying these ancient cultures, we can learn about their daily lives, their struggles, and their achievements, gaining a deeper understanding of the human experience.

Prehistory is the time period before recorded history. Before people could write, they passed down their stories and knowledge through art, stories, and oral traditions. Archaeologists study the artifacts, tools, and other remains left behind by these ancient cultures to learn about their lives. They use these clues to piece together the past and create a timeline of human development. From the early Stone Age tools to the complex civilizations of ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and Greece, prehistory spans millions of years. It's a fascinating journey through time, revealing the struggles and achievements of our ancestors. By studying prehistory, we gain a deeper understanding of how human societies evolved, adapted, and interacted with their environments. This knowledge helps us appreciate the rich cultural heritage that has shaped our world today.

Prehistory refers to the time period before written records existed. This was a time when humans did not have a written language and therefore did not leave behind any written documents that historians can study. Before the invention of writing, people relied on oral traditions and passed down their history, culture, and knowledge through storytelling and other forms of expression. Archaeologists use artifacts, such as tools, pottery, and buildings, to learn about the past. They also study the natural environment and changes in the climate to gain insights into how people lived and adapted to their surroundings. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the earliest human societies and how they developed into the complex civilizations of today.

Here is my attempt at explaining prehistory to someone reading at the High School level:
Prehistory refers to the time period before recorded history, when humans lived and developed without leaving behind written records. During this time, early humans developed tools, learned to control fire, and began to domesticate animals. They also started to migrate to different parts of the world, settling in various regions and developing unique cultures. Archaeologists study prehistory by analyzing the artifacts and remains left behind by ancient civilizations. These clues provide valuable information about the lives of our ancestors, allowing us to piece together their daily lives, social structures, and technological advancements. By examining these remnants, we can gain a deeper understanding of how human societies evolved over time, from simple hunter-gatherer groups to complex civilizations.

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 150 words that follows your plan. 
Prehistory is the period before written records existed. It spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. This era is not recorded in history books like the events after writing were. People from this time left behind artifacts, like tools and pottery, which provide clues about their lives and cultures. These objects are like puzzles, and archaeologists try to figure out what they mean. Archaeologists are scientists who study the past by examining these artifacts and other remains like bones and ruins. By looking at the artifacts and how people used them, archaeologists can reconstruct the daily lives of people from prehistoric times. This helps us understand the evolution of human societies and how they developed over time.

Step 4: Review the paragraph for content, clarity, and grammar.

It includes all the time before the invention of writing, roughly from the first humans to about 5,000 years ago. During prehistory, people used images, stories, and objects to pass on their history and traditions. Archaeologists study these remains to learn about life in the past. They find clues like tools, buildings, and artifacts that show how people lived, hunted, and farmed. The discovery of fossils and ancient DNA also provides important information. While we can't know for certain how people lived, archaeologists can make educated guesses based on the evidence they find. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the earliest human societies and how they adapted to their environments.

**Final Answer:** 

**Uncovering the Secrets of the Past**

Prehistory is a period of time that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing. This time frame is often divided into several distinct periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras. During these eras, early humans developed tools, hunted for food, and began to settle in permanent locations. They also started to domesticate plants and animals, which marked the beginning of agriculture. These early humans left behind artifacts, such as stone tools and cave paintings, that provide valuable insights into their daily lives and cultures. By studying these artifacts, historians and archaeologists can reconstruct the lives of our",9.6,55.13,11.5,12.2,11.41,11.83,5.16,7.7142857142857135

Prehistory is a period of time that spans millions of years before written records began. This era started with the emergence of the first life forms on Earth, such as single-celled organisms, and ended with the invention of writing around 5,000 years ago. During prehistory, early humans evolved and developed complex societies, tools, and technologies. The Paleolithic Era, also known as the Stone Age, is one of the most well-known periods of prehistory. It lasted from about 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago and saw the emergence of early humans like Homo sapiens and Homo erectus. These early humans lived in small groups, hunted for food, and developed basic tools from stones and bones. The prehistoric period is a fascinating time in human history, filled with discoveries and mysteries waiting to be uncovered.

The era of prehistory is the period before the development of written records. This period spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing, which marks the beginning of history. During prehistory, societies were primarily oral, meaning they relied on word of mouth to pass down knowledge and traditions. As a result, we have limited information about the cultures and events of this time. Archaeologists, however, use archaeological evidence such as tools, artifacts, and fossil records to reconstruct the lives of ancient societies. By studying these remnants, we can gain a glimpse into the past and understand the development of human civilization. Prehistory is a vast and complex era that spans millions of years, and its study helps us appreciate the rich cultural heritage of human societies.

The final answer is: 
The era of prehistory is the period before the development of written records. This period spans from the emergence of the first humans",9.4,55.54,10.9,12.6,10.59,11.71,4.86,8.428571428571429
