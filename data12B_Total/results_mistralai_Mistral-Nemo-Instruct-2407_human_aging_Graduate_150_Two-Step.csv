Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. The summary should cover the following topics:
1. Definition of human aging
2. Factors influencing human aging
3. Key biological changes
4. Social and psychological aspects

Human aging refers to the progressive and irreversible decline in physiological functions that occurs in humans over time. This process is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetic predisposition, and extrinsic factors, like lifestyle, environment, and disease. Key biological changes include cellular senescence, telomere shortening, DNA damage, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These lead to declines in organ function, increased risk of disease, and ultimately, mortality. Socially, aging is accompanied by changes in roles, relationships, and social status. Psychologically, it involves coping with these changes and adapting to new circumstances. Successful aging requires a balance between maintaining physical health, preserving cognitive function, and fostering social engagement.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Graduate and limit the output to 150 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by progressive declines in physiological functions and increased susceptibility to diseases. It is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetics and cellular changes, and extrinsic factors like environment and lifestyle. Key aspects include telomere shortening, DNA damage, oxidative stress, and mitochondrial dysfunction. Age-related changes in the immune system, known as immunosenescence, increase the risk of infections and cancer. Lifestyle factors like smoking, poor diet, and physical inactivity can accelerate aging. Regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and stress management can slow down aging and promote healthy longevity.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Graduate and limit the output to 150 words:

These changes contribute to various age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the mechanisms of aging is crucial for developing interventions to improve healthspan and lifespan. Research in this field has led to the identification of several molecular pathways involved in aging, including sirtuins, mTOR, and AMPK. Targeting these pathways may offer potential therapies to delay or reverse the aging process. However, more research is needed to fully understand the complex interplay between these pathways and to develop effective, safe, and widely accessible interventions for human aging.",13.3,29.14,15.1,14.6,15.06,16.24,6.54,10.571428571428571
