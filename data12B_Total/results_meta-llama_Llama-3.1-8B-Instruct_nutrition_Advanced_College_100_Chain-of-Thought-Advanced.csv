Nutrition is the science of how the body uses food. It's like a car's engine, needing the right fuel to run smoothly. Just as a car needs gasoline, our bodies need the right foods to work properly. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are the main types of fuel for our bodies. Each type is important for different functions. For example, carbohydrates give us energy to move and think. Proteins help build and fix muscles and other tissues. Fats help our bodies absorb important vitamins and minerals.

Step 5: Count the total words, total sentences, and total syllables in the paragraph to calculate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level.

The paragraph contains 56 words, 8 sentences, and 106 syllables. Using the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula, we get:

Nutrition is the science of food and how it affects the body. It includes understanding what nutrients are, how they work together, and what happens when we eat them. Nutrition also considers the relationships between food, health, and disease. The process of nutrition involves the digestion, absorption, and utilization of nutrients. It affects the body's growth, maintenance, and repair. Nutrition plays a crucial role in the prevention and treatment of diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. The science of nutrition is constantly evolving as new research and technologies become available.
