Prehistory is the time before written records were kept, often referred to as the Stone Age. It's divided into three periods: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During the Paleolithic, people were nomadic hunters and gatherers. They used simple stone tools and lived in small groups. In the Mesolithic, as the climate warmed, people started to live near water sources and developed fishing skills. They also used more advanced tools made from bone and wood. The Neolithic brought significant changes. People began to settle in one place, farm land, and domesticate animals. They also invented new tools like pottery and started building homes with mud bricks. Prehistory ended when people started writing down their history.",7.5,60.51,10.2,10.5,9.24,12.74,4.22,5.5

In the prehistory times, people didn't write books or keep records. So, we don't have exact dates or events from this period. But, we can learn about it by studying fossils, stones, and other things that people made. These help us understand how people lived, what they ate, and how they worked. The prehistory period is split into three main parts: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. Each part is named for the type of tools people used. In the Stone Age, people used tools made of stone. Then, they started using metal, first bronze, and then iron. This made their tools stronger and better. These changes helped people to farm, build homes, and create art. Prehistory ended around 5,000 years ago when people started writing history down.",5.4,76.72,7.4,8.6,6.48,8.62,3.38,6.5

Prehistory is the time before written records, when humans had not yet developed writing systems. During this period, people lived as hunters and gatherers, moving from place to place to find food and other resources. They used tools made from stone, bone, and wood, and relied on their knowledge of nature for survival. Prehistory is often divided into different periods based on changes in climate and technology, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Archaeologists study these periods by examining the artifacts and fossils left behind by early humans. Despite the lack of written records, we can learn a lot about prehistory through the study of these physical remains.",9.6,55.13,11.5,12.2,11.4,12.12,5.11,8.571428571428571

Prehistory is the time before written records, so it's hard for us to know exactly what happened. Scientists study things like tools, art, and bones to learn about these early people. They call this field 'archaeology'. People in prehistory lived in different ways. Some were nomads, moving around looking for food. Others lived in villages, farming the land. They didn't have the technology we have today, like computers or cars. Instead, they used tools made from stones, bones, and wood. Despite the lack of records, we can still learn a lot about prehistory through the clues left behind.",6.2,69.28,8.4,9.6,8.03,10.18,3.81,4.7272727272727275

It ends when people started writing things down, around 3400 BC. This era includes the Stone Age, when people used stones for tools, and the Bronze Age, when they started using metals.

Prehistory is a long period of time before written records were kept. It started when humans first appeared on Earth, over 2 million years ago. During this time, people didn't have books or newspapers to write down their history. So, we don't have direct records from them. Archaeologists, who study old artifacts, and paleontologists, who study fossils, help us learn about prehistory. They find tools, art, and bones that tell us how people lived long ago. For example, they've found cave paintings in France that are over 30,000 years old! These show us what life was like during prehistory. It was a time of big changes, as people learned to use fire, make tools, and live in different places.

They lived in small groups called tribes and moved around a lot. They learned to make tools from stone and bone, and they hunted animals for food. As time passed, they started to grow crops and live in one place. This helped them create art, build shelters, and share knowledge with others.
