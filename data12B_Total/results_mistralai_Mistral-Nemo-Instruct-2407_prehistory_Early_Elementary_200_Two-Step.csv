""Prehistory"" is the time before we had books to write down our stories. It goes back to when people first appeared. We divide it into three big parts: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.

The Stone Age is the longest. It has three parts: Old, Middle, and New Stone Age. In the Old Stone Age, people used stones as tools. They hunted animals and gathered food. In the Middle Stone Age, people started living near water. They made boats and fished. In the New Stone Age, people learned to grow food. They also started keeping animals like cows and chickens.

The Bronze Age came later. People learned to make strong tools and weapons from bronze. This made life easier. The Iron Age came after that. People made even stronger tools and weapons from iron.

During these times, people started living together in groups. They made art and believed in gods. They created rules for living together. We can learn about these",6.6,68.36,8.4,9.7,8.3,10.07,3.98,10.333333333333334

Revised version (Early Elementary, 200 words):

Long ago, before people could write, there was a time called 'prehistory'. It started with the Big Bang, 13.8 billion years ago. Earth was born 4.6 billion years ago. First, tiny life forms like bacteria appeared. Then, more complex life forms, like plants and animals, emerged. Dinosaurs walked the Earth, and mammals, including humans, came later. This all happened before people could write things down. The last part of prehistory ends around 5,000 years ago when people in a place called Mesopotamia started writing.

Prehistory is the time before we could write things down. It starts when the first humans appeared and ends when we learned to write. It's split into three big parts. The first part is called the Stone Age. This time lasted a very long time, from about 3 million years ago to 5000 years ago. During this time, early humans like Homo habilis and Homo sapiens lived. They started using stones as tools and learned to control fire. The next part is the Bronze Age. This happened from around 5000 to 2000 years ago. People started making tools and weapons from bronze, a special kind of metal. The last part is the Iron Age. This began around 2000 years ago. People started using iron for tools, which helped them farm better, fight better",6.4,74.19,8.6,9.3,8.21,9.68,4.07,10.333333333333334

**Early Elementary Version:**

Long ago, before people wrote things down, there was a time called 'prehistory'. It's like a big story with three parts. The first part is called the 'Old Stone Age'. It started a very, very long time ago, around 3 million years back, and ended 10,000 years before today. People in this time used stones for tools and were early humans like Homo habilis and Homo sapiens. The second part is the 'Middle Stone Age'. This happened from 10,000 years before today until 5,000 years before today. People started to live in one place instead of moving around all the time. The last part is the 'New Stone Age'. It was from 5,000 years before today until 3,000 years before today. During this time, people started growing their own food and taking care of animals. They also built houses that",8.1,64.3,10.1,10.5,9.28,10.32,4.35,10.333333333333334

During the Stone Age, humans relied on stone tools for hunting, gathering, and other activities.

In simpler terms, prehistory is the time before people wrote things down. It starts when early humans first made stone tools, about 2.6 million years ago. It ends when different civilizations began writing things down, around 5,000 years ago. This time is divided into three big parts based on what people used to make tools: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. In the Stone Age, people used stones for tools. In the Bronze Age, they started using bronze for tools and weapons. In the Iron Age, they switched to using iron. Scientists study this time by looking at old things people left behind, like tools and art. They've found out many interesting things about how early humans lived, like how they used fire and made art.",8.1,64.3,10.3,11.4,10.11,11.02,4.34,11.5
