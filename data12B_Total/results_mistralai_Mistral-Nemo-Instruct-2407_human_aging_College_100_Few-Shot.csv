Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Human aging is the process where the human body gradually loses its youthful functions and appearance. This occurs due to wear and tear, as well as genetic factors. While aging is inevitable, some actions like maintaining a healthy diet and exercising regularly can slow down the process. Aging also comes with a tradeoff: while it provides wisdom and experience, it also increases the risk of various diseases.",12.5,47.62,14.9,14.8,14.1,12.54,6.22,17.75

Human aging is a process that occurs naturally over time. It is marked by physical changes such as wrinkles, grey hair, and slower reflexes. Aging also brings about cognitive changes, like reduced memory and processing speed. Some theories suggest that aging is a result of accumulated damage to cells and tissues over time, while others propose that it is programmed into our genes. The goal of gerontology, the study of aging, is to understand and mitigate the negative effects of aging, while preserving the positive aspects.",12.4,47.83,14.7,14.9,14.19,12.48,6.17,17.75

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Human aging is the biological process where an organism changes over time, typically growing old. It's a complex process influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and environment. Aging can be seen as protective, as it allows species to adapt and survive, but it also causes deterioration in physical and mental abilities. This deterioration is inevitable, but some aspects can be slowed or managed through lifestyle changes and medical advancements.",13.6,39.16,15.3,15.1,14.3,12.94,6.24,17.75

Biological aging, or human aging, is a complex process that involves the gradual decline of physiological functions over time. Aging is a universal phenomenon that affects all living organisms, including humans. It is a multifaceted process that encompasses various aspects, such as cellular senescence, genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, and mitochondrial dysfunction. The underlying goal of aging research is to understand and mitigate the negative consequences of aging, thereby improving the quality of life for older adults.",13.9,38.45,16.1,16.1,15.62,13.58,6.57,17.75
