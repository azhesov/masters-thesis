**Upper Elementary Readable Version:**

Long ago, before people could write, there was a time called 'prehistory'. It started with the Big Bang, which made the universe, and ended when people first wrote things down, around 5,000 years ago.

Prehistory is split into three big parts. First, there was the 'Cosmic Era'. This was when the universe was made, and then the Earth formed, about 13 billion years ago. Next came the 'Geologic Era'. This was when life on Earth started, about 4 billion years ago. The last part is called the 'Biologic Era'. This started when life began and ended when people started writing things down.

The Biologic Era had many smaller parts, based on what kinds of life were most common and how the Earth changed. Some of these parts are called the Precamb",7.7,65.42,9.3,10.4,8.24,9.85,4.17,7.25

**Rewritten Text (Upper Elementary, 200 words):**

Prehistory is a very long time ago, before people wrote things down. It starts with the first humans and ends when writing was invented. We divide this time into three big parts: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.

The Stone Age is the longest part. It has three smaller parts too: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. In the Paleolithic, people moved around a lot, hunting animals and gathering food. In the Mesolithic, they started living in one place more, and in the Neolithic, they started farming and building houses.

The Bronze Age was when people learned to make things from bronze, like tools and weapons. The Iron Age was when they started using iron for these things.

To learn about prehistory, we use something called archaeology. Archaeologists look at old",8.9,56.96,10.8,11.6,9.59,11.88,4.26,10.142857142857142

It began around 3.3 million years ago with the first stone tools used by early hominids and ended with the invention of writing, around 3200 BCE in Mesopotamia. Prehistory is divided into several epochs, including the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). Each epoch is characterized by distinct cultural and technological developments. For example, the Paleolithic saw the emergence of Homo sapiens and the development of complex hunting and gathering societies, while the Neolithic witnessed the domestication of plants and animals, leading to the rise of agriculture and permanent settlements.

The term 'prehistory' is used because humans didn't write down their history until much later. Before that, people relied on oral stories, art, and cultural practices to pass down knowledge. Archaeologists study prehistory by examining artifacts, fossils, and other physical remains left behind by ancient civilizations. This helps us understand how people lived, what tools they used, and how they interacted with their environment. By studying prehistory, we gain insights into our collective past and appreciate the journey of human evolution.",9.3,55.84,11.7,11.8,11.02,12.53,4.97,6.625
