Paragraph:
Prehistory is the time before written records. It started at the beginning of human existence and ended when people began to write. This period covers millions of years. It includes important events like the evolution of humans and the use of tools.

**Plan:**

1. Use simple vocabulary and short sentences.
2. Focus on defining 'prehistory' and its relation to history.
3. Explain that it's a time before written records.

**Paragraph:**

""Prehistory is the time before written records. It's like history's early days, when people didn't write things down. This period ends when people started making books, around 3200 BC. Before that, we learn about life through paintings, tools, and other things people left behind.""

**Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Calculation:**

- Total words: 42
- Total sentences: 4
- Total syllables: 72

Using the formula: 0.39 × (42 / 4) + 11.8 × (72 / 42) - 15.59 = 7.38
