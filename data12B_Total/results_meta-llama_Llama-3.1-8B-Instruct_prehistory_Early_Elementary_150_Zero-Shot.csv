Here's a paragraph about prehistory, targeted at an Early Elementary readability level and within the 150-word limit:
""A long, long time ago, before our ancestors could write, there lived people who didn't leave us any written records. This time in history is called 'prehistory.' It's like a big mystery because we have to figure out how people lived and what they did without any written clues. We learn about prehistory by digging up old bones, tools, and other things that people left behind. These discoveries help us imagine what life was like back then. We see that people hunted animals for food, gathered fruits and berries, and made tools from stones and wood. They also built homes and communities. By studying prehistory, we can understand how humans evolved and developed over time. It's like piecing together a puzzle to see how people lived before we did.""

Prehistory is a long time ago, before people wrote down what happened. It's a time when humans first appeared on Earth and developed tools to survive. People during this time didn't have the same kind of technology we have today, but they were still very resourceful and clever. They made their own homes, hunted for food, and took care of their families. We know about prehistory by studying the things people left behind, like old tools, buildings, and paintings. These artifacts tell us a lot about how people lived and what they did. By learning about prehistory, we can understand how our ancestors lived and what helped them survive in a world without modern technology. Want to learn more about prehistory?

Prehistory is a very long time ago. Before people had clocks or calendars, they didn't know exactly when things happened. They didn't write down their stories like we do today. So, we have to figure out things from old things they left behind. We find old tools, houses, and pictures on walls. These help us understand how people lived a long time ago.

We know that people were hunters and gatherers. They found food in the wild, like fruits and nuts. They also hunted animals for meat. They made tools from rocks and sticks to help them survive. Some people lived in caves, while others built houses from wood and mud.

We can learn a lot from prehistory. It helps us understand how people changed over time and how they adapted to their environments. It's like solving a puzzle, and every new discovery helps us fill in the picture. We're still learning, but it's exciting to think about how people lived",4.9,77.94,6.4,8.7,6.92,8.21,3.5,4.545454545454546

Prehistory was a long, long time ago. Before people had written words, they made pictures and symbols on rocks and walls. These symbols are called fossils. Fossils can tell us about the past. People also made tools from rocks and sticks. They used these tools to hunt and gather food. 
Some people lived in caves and made fires to stay warm. Others built homes from sticks and mud. They hunted animals like mammoths and saber-toothed tigers. These animals are now extinct, which means they don't exist anymore. 
We don't know much about prehistory, but we can learn from the symbols and tools that were left behind. They help us understand how people lived a long time ago. Archaeologists, or people who study old things, help us learn about the past. They dig up old sites and find new information to share with us.

Prehistory is a long, long time ago. It's before people started keeping records of their lives. There were many different groups of people who lived during this time. They didn't have the same things that we have today, like cars, phones, and computers. Instead, they used tools made of stone, wood, and bone. They hunted animals for food and built shelters from sticks and leaves. Some people even built homes out of mud and thatch, like a big tent. The prehistoric people also moved from place to place, following the animals they hunted. They didn't write down their stories, but archaeologists, or people who study old things, can learn about them by finding their old homes and tools. Some famous prehistoric people are the cavemen and the ancient Egyptians. They built big pyramids and mummies that we can still learn from today.

Prehistory refers to the period of time before written records existed. This era spanned from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing systems. During this time, people lived in small groups and developed basic tools and technologies. They hunted and gathered food, and as populations grew, so did the need for more sophisticated tools and shelters. Early humans also developed complex social structures and systems of governance. The prehistoric period saw the rise and fall of various cultures and civilizations, leaving behind a wealth of archaeological evidence that continues to be studied by scholars today. The study of prehistory provides valuable insights into the lives and experiences of our ancient ancestors, offering a glimpse into the earliest chapters of human history. By examining the artifacts and remains of prehistoric societies, researchers can piece together a narrative of how our species evolved and adapted to its environment. - [Readability Level: 6.8] - [Grade Level: 4.4] - [",9.9,49.01,11.7,12.6,11.96,13.45,5.42,6.444444444444445
