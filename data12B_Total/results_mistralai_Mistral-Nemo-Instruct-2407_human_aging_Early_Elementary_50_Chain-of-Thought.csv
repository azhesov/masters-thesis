Aging is when people grow older. It happens to everyone. As we age, our bodies change. We might move slower, need glasses to see, or have less energy. Our skin wrinkles too.

Human aging is when people grow old. As we get older, our body changes. We might not run as fast or see as well. Our skin might wrinkle. Our hair may turn gray or fall out. Inside our body, things change too. Cells get older and don't work as well. Our heart might not pump as strongly. We might need more rest. But don't worry, we still have lots of time to play, learn, and explore.",3.2,87.82,4.1,6.5,4.85,5.54,3.13,4.0

Human aging is like a plant growing. We start as a tiny seed, then grow into a big, strong tree. But unlike plants, we don't stay the same size forever. Instead, our bodies change slowly over time. We get taller, then stop growing. Our hair changes color, and our skin gets wrinkles. This is all part of growing up and getting older, just like a plant does. In the end, we become wise and experienced, just like an old tree.",5.3,76.93,5.5,7.5,6.3,6.59,3.57,5.222222222222222

Here's an example of how you might complete this activity:

**Step 1:** I will explain 'human aging' as the process where our bodies change over time, like when we grow up from being a baby to an adult.

**Step 2:** I will use words like 'change', 'time', 'bodies', 'grow', and 'up'.

**Step 3:** ""As time goes by, our bodies change. When we are babies, we grow up. This is like aging, but for our whole lives.""

**Step 4:** My paragraph is clear and easy to understand. I used simple sentences and appropriate vocabulary.

**Step 5:** I will share my paragraph with my teacher and ask if they think it's easy to",6.0,75.1,7.2,8.2,6.76,6.71,3.53,7.2857142857142865

Aging is when people get older. It starts at birth and happens to everyone. As time goes by, our bodies change. We grow taller, then stop. Our hair turns gray or white. We might need glasses to see far away. Our bones and muscles get weaker. But, our brains keep learning and growing! We become wise and have many stories to tell. Aging is a normal part of life.
