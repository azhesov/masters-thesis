Human aging is a complex, multi-faceted process characterized by progressive, cumulative changes at molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. It is marked by a decline in physiological function, increased susceptibility to diseases, and heightened risk of death. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood but involve interconnected processes such as telomere shortening, DNA damage accumulation, mitochondrial dysfunction, and altered cellular communication.",12.5,31.28,15.1,13.7,14.08,16.81,6.35,10.285714285714286

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. Human aging, a complex biological process, is characterized by a progressive decline in physiological functions and an increased susceptibility to disease and death. It is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with telomere shortening and DNA damage being two key molecular mechanisms. These changes lead to cellular senescence and apoptosis, contributing to tissue and organ dysfunction.",11.7,38.82,13.1,12.7,13.51,14.44,6.17,10.583333333333334

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive functional decline and increased susceptibility to diseases. It results from the cumulative effect of cellular damage and stress, including oxidative stress, telomere shortening, and epigenetic alterations. Aging is influenced by both intrinsic (genetic and cellular) and extrinsic (environmental and lifestyle) factors. Understanding the mechanisms underlying aging is crucial for developing interventions to extend healthy lifespan and prevent age-related diseases.",12.7,30.87,15.3,14.1,15.52,17.04,6.72,10.714285714285714
