Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?""

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Nutrition is what we eat and drink. It helps our body grow strong and healthy. Imagine you are a plant. You need sun, water, and soil to grow. In the same way, humans need certain foods for good nutrition. Milk has calcium, which helps our bones grow strong. Fruits and vegetables have vitamins that help us stay healthy.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. Describe what nutrition is and why it's important.

Nutrition is like the food and water that plants, animals, and people need to grow and stay healthy. Just like how the Sun's light helps plants grow, nutrition helps our bodies. It gives us energy to play, learn, and run around. Without good nutrition, we might feel tired or get sick. So, eating fruits, vegetables, and other healthy foods is important.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. The paragraph should explain how some foods give us more energy than others and use an example of an apple and a cookie.

An apple and a cookie are both foods, but they give us different amounts of energy. The apple is like the white shirt in Example 2. It has light colors inside, like the white parts of fruits and vegetables. These light colors give us less energy. That's why we don't feel as full or as energetic after eating an apple. A cookie is more like the black shirt. It has dark colors inside, like the brown parts of grains and sweets. These dark colors give us more energy. That's why we feel full and energetic after eating a cookie. So, eating more apples and other light-colored foods can help us stay healthy, while eating too many cookies and other dark-colored foods might make us feel tired or sick.",2.0,96.48,2.5,6.9,4.48,3.38,2.51,2.1875

Nutrition helps us grow. We eat many foods to get nutrition. Then we ask, ""Is this food nutritious?"" But it's not always easy to know. We need to look for fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. They give us the best nutrition.",1.5,97.6,1.7,6.5,4.38,2.62,2.49,2.1875

Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird.

But the owl says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose. Maybe it is her egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, ""Is this your egg?""

The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
