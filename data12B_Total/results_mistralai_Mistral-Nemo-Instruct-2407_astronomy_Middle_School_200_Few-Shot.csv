In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

Some stars are young, like beans fresh from the pod, while others are old, like beans that have been dried for a long time.

- The first astronomers used their eyes to observe the sky.
- They recorded their observations, which helped others understand the movement of celestial bodies.
- Today, astronomers use powerful telescopes to study the sky.
- These telescopes are much stronger than human eyes.

Astronomy is the fascinating study of stars, planets, and other far-off space bodies. In the beginning, curious people called astronomers looked up at the sky with their own eyes. They recorded what they saw, helping others understand how these celestial bodies moved. Today, astronomers use mighty telescopes to explore the heavens.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

""In the vast, dark night sky, stars twinkle like tiny, distant diamonds. These stars are like suns, but much, much farther away. Astronomers, scientists who study the sky, use powerful telescopes to see them better. Some stars are so far that their light takes thousands of years to reach our eyes. Other stars are in groups called galaxies, like our own Milky Way. Just like the beans, straw, and coal in the old woman's story, stars have their own special stories. They are born, live, and die in ways we're still learning about.""",7.7,76.15,9.6,8.5,9.41,7.25,4.6,11.0

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'astronomy' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 200 words. The topic of this paragraph is 'Astronomers and their telescopes'.

Astronomers are scientists who study the sky and the stars. They use special tools called telescopes. Telescopes are like big eyes that let astronomers see far into the universe. Some telescopes are so powerful that they can show stars that are millions of light-years away. This is like seeing a single bean on the ground from high above in a plane! Astronomers also use telescopes to study planets, galaxies, and even black holes. They light their telescopes with special lights to see better in the dark. These lights are like the coal that jumps out of a fire, helping astronomers to see clearly in the night sky. Without telescopes, astronomers would be like the old woman in the story, unable to see her bean clearly.",7.5,76.76,9.5,8.0,9.04,7.66,4.52,11.0
