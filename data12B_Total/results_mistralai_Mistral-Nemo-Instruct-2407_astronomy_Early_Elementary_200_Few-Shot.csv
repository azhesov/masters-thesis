Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?""

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

- Explain what astronomy is.
- Mention the Moon and a star.
- Talk about how astronomers use telescopes.
- Describe what astronomers learn from studying the sky.

Astronomy is looking at the sky to learn about space. In the night, we can see the Moon. It is big and round. It shines bright in the dark sky. Next to it, we can see a star. Stars are very far away. We can't touch them, but we can look at them with a telescope. Astronomers use telescopes to see far things in space. They look at the Moon and stars. They also look at planets and galaxies. By studying the sky, astronomers learn many things. They learn how things move in space. They also learn about the universe's history. Isn't that amazing?",1.5,97.7,2.0,6.3,4.11,3.09,2.51,2.1875

Astronomy is like looking at the sky with a special interest. It's about learning about stars, planets, and even far-away galaxies! For example, let's talk about the Moon. The Moon is a big, bright rock that goes around Earth. Sometimes, we can see it in the day, and sometimes at night. It changes shape too! You can draw the Moon's phases at home.

Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?"" But the owl says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose. Maybe it is her egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, ""Is this your egg?"" But the goose says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the two ducks. Maybe it is their egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the two ducks. They ask the two ducks, ""Is this your egg?"" But the two ducks say, ""No, that is not our egg."" Then the egg breaks.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'astronomy' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words. In the paragraph, mention the following points:
- Stars and planets are very far away.
- Telescopes help us see them.
- Space is very big and dark.
- We learn about space by looking at it.

Stars and planets are far away. They are so far that we can’t see them with our eyes. We need special tools called telescopes to see them. Space is very big. It is also very dark. You can’t see anything in space without a telescope. Astronomy is the study of space. People who study astronomy use telescopes to look at stars and planets. They learn about space by looking at it with their telescopes.",1.6,97.5,1.9,6.1,4.09,2.86,2.46,2.1875
