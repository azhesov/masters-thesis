During the time known as prehistory, humans lived without writing or records. This meant that they left behind no written accounts of their lives. Despite this, archaeologists have found many clues that help us understand how people lived during this time. They have discovered tools made from stone, bone, and wood. These tools show that people were skilled hunters and gatherers, able to adapt to their environments. Archaeologists have also found evidence of early farming, which allowed people to settle in one place and build communities. As a result, prehistoric people developed social hierarchies, with leaders and special roles within their communities. We can also learn about prehistoric people from the art they created, such as cave paintings and carvings. These works of art give us a glimpse into the lives and cultures of people who lived long ago. By studying these clues, we can piece together a picture of what life was like during the time of prehistory. It is a fascinating",7.3,66.54,9.7,10.6,9.17,11.18,4.28,6.111111111111111

Prehistory refers to the time period before written records existed. It's a mysterious and intriguing time when humans first roamed the earth. During this era, our ancestors lived in small tribes, hunted for food, and gathered fruits and vegetables. They were skilled at making tools from stone, bone, and wood, which helped them survive in a harsh environment. Over time, people began to settle in one place, developing more complex societies and cultures. The invention of the wheel around 4000 BCE revolutionized transportation and trade, leading to the rise of cities and civilizations. As civilizations grew, so did the need for writing, which marked the beginning of recorded history. Prehistory is a fascinating period that helps us understand how humans evolved and developed into the societies we see today. By studying the artifacts and remains from this time, we can learn about our ancestors' daily lives, struggles, and achievements, and gain a deeper appreciation for the history that shaped our world.

The term 'prehistory' refers to the period of human existence before written records. During this time, humans developed from a common ancestor with other primates. The earliest human-like species, such as Homo habilis, emerged around 2.8 million years ago in Africa. These early humans likely lived in small groups, hunting and gathering food. They also developed basic tools, like stone knives and clubs. Over time, human species evolved and became more complex, with the emergence of Homo erectus, who controlled fire and migrated out of Africa. The Homo sapiens, our own species, appeared around 300,000 years ago in Africa. Early humans developed social structures, languages, and art, laying the foundation for modern human society. The study of prehistory helps us understand the origins of humans and our place in the world. It is a fascinating field that continues to uncover new information about our ancient past.

The term 'prehistory' refers to the period of time before written records existed. This era is often divided into three sub-periods: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During the Paleolithic period, which lasted from approximately 2.5 million years ago to 10,000 BCE, early humans roamed the Earth and developed basic tools. The Mesolithic period, spanning from around 10,000 BCE to 5,000 BCE, saw the emergence of more complex societies and the introduction of new technologies. The Neolithic period, from around 5,000 BCE to 2,000 BCE, is characterized by the rise of settled agriculture and the development of more sophisticated societies.

Prehistory is the study of the time before written records existed. This time period, which spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing, is often divided into three main stages: the Paleolithic Era, the Mesolithic Era, and the Neolithic Era. During the Paleolithic Era, humans lived in small groups, hunting and gathering food. They created simple tools, such as stone knives and clubs, to survive. As time passed, humans began to adapt to their environments, developing new tools and ways of living. In the Mesolithic Era, humans started to settle in one place, building shelters and developing more complex societies. The Neolithic Era saw the rise of agriculture, with humans domesticating plants and animals to grow their own food. This marked a significant shift in human history, as people began to live in more permanent settlements and develop more complex societies. Overall, prehistory is a fascinating time period that helps us understand the origins of human civilization.

Prehistory is the time before written records. It's the period when humans first appeared on Earth, about 6 million years ago. During this time, early humans, like Homo sapiens, developed tools, hunted for food, and settled in different parts of the world. They built shelters, like caves and huts, to protect themselves from the elements. 

As humans evolved, they began to communicate with each other using languages, signs, and gestures. They also developed agriculture, which allowed them to grow their own food and settle in one place for longer periods. This marked the beginning of settled communities, where people lived together in villages and towns. 

The prehistoric era is often divided into three periods: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). Each period saw significant advancements in human society, like the development of more sophisticated tools and the creation of art and artifacts.

Prehistory is the time period before written records existed. It is a vast and mysterious era that spans millions of years. During this time, the Earth was still changing and the first humans began to emerge. These early humans, such as Homo sapiens, were hunter-gatherers who roamed the land in search of food and shelter. They lived in small groups, often in caves or temporary shelters, and survived by hunting animals and gathering fruits, nuts, and berries. As humans developed and adapted to their environments, they began to create tools and technologies that helped them to thrive. They also developed languages, social structures, and cultural practices that allowed them to communicate, cooperate, and pass on their knowledge to future generations. The earliest humans likely migrated to different parts of the world, eventually populating every continent.
