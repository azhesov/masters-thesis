Step 4: Follow your plan and write the final paragraph. I will use astronomy to explain how the universe has changed over time. By studying the light coming from distant stars and galaxies, astronomers can determine the speed at which the universe is expanding. This expansion was caused by the Big Bang, a massive explosion that occurred around 13.8 billion years ago. The universe has been expanding ever since, with galaxies moving away from each other. Astronomers can also study the light from ancient stars to learn about the universe's past. For example, they can determine the age of the universe by studying the light from the oldest stars, which is much fainter than the light from younger stars. By studying the universe's history, astronomers can gain a deeper understanding of how it has changed over time. (approx. 104 words)
