Nutrition is like fuel for our bodies. It gives us the energy we need to run, play, and learn. Good nutrition means eating a variety of foods, like fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and proteins. These foods have different nutrients that our bodies need to stay healthy. For example, fruits and vegetables have vitamins and minerals that help us grow and fight off diseases. Whole grains give us fiber, which helps our digestive system work properly. Proteins are essential for building and repairing our tissues. To ensure good nutrition, we should aim to eat a balanced diet. This means not skipping meals and avoiding junk food as much as possible. Instead, we should opt for healthy snacks, such as an apple or a handful of nuts. In conclusion, understanding and maintaining good nutrition is key to leading a healthy and active life.",7.1,67.04,8.3,10.7,9.29,9.67,4.21,6.111111111111111
