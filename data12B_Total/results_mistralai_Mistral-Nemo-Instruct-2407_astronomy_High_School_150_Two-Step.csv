Rewritten Text:

Astronomy is the study of objects and events in space, like planets, stars, and galaxies. It's a mix of physics, math, and chemistry. Scientists, called astronomers, use telescopes on Earth and in space to gather information about these objects. They analyze this data to learn about the universe's origins, how it changes over time, and its basic rules. Astronomy helps us understand big ideas like the universe's structure, how it began (the Big Bang), and the discovery of planets outside our solar system. It also helps in space exploration and satellite technology. In short, astronomy helps us understand our universe and our place in it.",8.9,56.86,11.2,12.3,10.39,12.29,4.63,7.375
