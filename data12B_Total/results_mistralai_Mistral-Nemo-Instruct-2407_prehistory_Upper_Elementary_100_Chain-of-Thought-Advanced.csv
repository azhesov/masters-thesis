This change marked the end of prehistory and the start of recorded history.

Here's my plan:
- Use simple sentences and words.
- Avoid complex grammar structures.
- Use transition words to connect ideas.
- Focus on key aspects of prehistory: time period, lack of written records, and important events.

Now, let's start with the writing process:

Prehistory is the time before written records. This period covers the beginning of human life on Earth until people started writing things down. It lasted for a very long time, around 3 million years. During prehistory, humans lived as hunters and gatherers. They made tools from stones and bones. Important events happened, like the spread of humans across the world. However, we know about this time mainly from archeology and other scientific methods.

Here is the final paragraph:

""Prehistory refers to the time before people started recording history, or writing things down. This period covers everything from the dawn of humans until the invention of writing. It's a vast stretch of time, spanning thousands of years. During prehistory, humans lived as hunters and gatherers, relying on nature for food and shelter. They didn't have technology like we do today, so they used simple tools and lived in small groups called tribes. Prehistory ended around 3000 BCE when people in different parts of the world began writing things down.""
