Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 100 words. 

Prehistory is the period of human history before the invention of writing. It is a broad term that encompasses the entirety of human existence, from the emergence of the first hominids to the development of writing systems. This period is often divided into several distinct periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During prehistory, humans developed tools, hunted and gathered food, and eventually transitioned to more complex societies and civilizations. The study of prehistory relies heavily on archaeological evidence and the interpretation of material culture. Understanding prehistory provides valuable insights into the origins of human societies and the evolution of human culture.
