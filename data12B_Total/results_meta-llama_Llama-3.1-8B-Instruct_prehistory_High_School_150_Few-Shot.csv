Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded.

Prehistory is the age-old term for the era of time that came before the invention of writing. It was a period marked by primitive societies, where information and knowledge were passed down through oral traditions. The lives of our prehistoric ancestors were likely very different from our own, with limited access to technology and resources. As a result, their way of life was shaped by the environment and their surroundings. Fossil records and archaeological discoveries have given us a glimpse into the lives of prehistoric people, revealing their customs, tools, and ways of living. Through the study of prehistory, we can learn about the evolution of human societies, from simple hunting and gathering groups to complex civilizations. The prehistoric era laid the foundation for the modern world, and its legacy continues to shape our understanding of human history.

Prehistory was a period of human history, before the invention of writing, when stories and information were passed down orally. During this time, humans lived in small tribes, often in close proximity to natural resources. The climate and geography of a region greatly influenced the way of life of its people. In prehistoric times, people developed tools made from stone, bone, and wood, which allowed them to hunt, gather, and farm. The discovery of fire and the development of language also played significant roles in the lives of prehistoric humans. The physical characteristics and social structures of prehistoric humans varied greatly depending on the region and climate they lived in. Many prehistoric humans left behind artifacts, such as carvings, paintings, and tools, which provide valuable insights into their lives and cultures. These artifacts serve as a window into the past.

Prehistory is the period of time before written records existed. It spans from the emergence of the first humans, around 2.5 million years ago, to the development of writing, which occurred independently in several civilizations. During prehistory, human societies were organized into small groups, and their way of life was largely determined by the natural environment. They relied on hunting and gathering for food, and developed tools and technologies to adapt to their surroundings. The climate and geography of the region played a significant role in shaping the course of human history, with variations in temperature and rainfall influencing the availability of food and resources. By studying prehistory, we can gain insight into the early stages of human development and the evolution of societies over time. Archaeological evidence and fossil records provide valuable information about prehistoric cultures.

Prehistory refers to the time period before written records were kept. This time span stretches back millions of years, and its end varies by culture and region. It includes the earliest human existence and the development of human societies. The prehistoric period is divided into several distinct eras, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. Each era is characterized by its unique tools, techniques, and cultural practices. The Paleolithic era is often referred to as the Old Stone Age, during which early humans used stone tools to hunt and gather food. The Mesolithic era, or Middle Stone Age, saw the development of more sophisticated tools and the establishment of more complex societies. The Neolithic era, or New Stone Age, marked the beginning of agriculture and the domestication of animals. Understanding prehistory is essential to understanding human evolution and the development of modern societies.

Prehistory is the study of the period of human history before written records were kept. It includes the time before the invention of the first written languages, approximately 5,000 years ago. During this time, humans developed from a few small groups of hunter-gatherers into large, complex societies. Archaeologists use artifacts such as tools, pottery, and other material remains to learn about the lives of people from prehistoric times. By analyzing these artifacts, researchers can reconstruct the daily lives, social structures, and cultures of ancient people. The study of prehistory helps us understand how human societies evolved and developed over time. It provides valuable insights into the origins of modern cultures and the history of human civilization. By studying prehistory, we can gain a deeper understanding of our own history and the complexities of human societies.

You can setup your calculator to work either in natural display or linear display. Natural display causes fractions, irrational numbers, expressions, and certain functions to be displayed as you see them on paper. Linear display causes fractions and other expressions to be displayed in a line. 
When we come across an expression such as 7 + 3 ÷ 10 × 1, it makes a difference how we choose which operations to perform first.
Scientific calculators have been programmed to follow preset mathematical rules. If we press the buttons in a certain order, the calculator does the operations according to the rules that it has been programmed with.

Before the dawn of recorded history, humans lived in prehistory. During this time, people developed and used tools made from stones, wood, and bones. The tools were crude and simple, yet they allowed early humans to hunt, gather food, and construct shelters. As societies grew, so did their knowledge of the natural world and the ability to adapt to different environments. The discovery of fire and the development of language are thought to be two of the most significant events in prehistory. The transition from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one that was more settled and agricultural marked a significant turning point in human history. The study of prehistory allows us to understand the origins of human society and the development of complex civilizations. Through archaeology and anthropology, we can reconstruct the lives of our ancient ancestors and gain insight into their daily experiences.

Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

Prehistory begins at the emergence of the first humans, and stretches until the rise of civilizations around the world. It is a time of vast changes, as humans transitioned from a nomadic lifestyle to one of settled agriculture, which in turn led to the growth of cities and complex societies. This period is often divided into three main stages: the Paleolithic era, which spans from the emergence of the first humans to the end of the last Ice Age; the Mesolithic era, which saw the development of more sophisticated tools and the beginning of the end of the nomadic lifestyle; and the Neolithic era, which saw the rise of settled agriculture and the beginning of the growth of complex societies. The prehistoric era is a time of great change and development, and its study provides valuable insights into the lives of our ancient ancestors. The discovery of fossils, artifacts, and other remnants of prehistoric cultures helps us to piece together the history of our species.  ​

Prehistory was a time of great transformation, with human societies evolving from small, nomadic groups to more complex and settled communities. This period is characterized by the emergence of early civilizations, such as those in Mesopotamia and Egypt, where people developed sophisticated systems of governance, agriculture, and architecture. The prehistoric era is often divided into several distinct periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each marked by significant technological and cultural advancements. The discovery of artifacts such as tools, pottery, and jewelry has provided valuable insights into the lives of our prehistoric ancestors. By studying these remnants of the past, we can gain a deeper understanding of the origins of human society and the development of complex cultures. The study of prehistory is essential for understanding the evolution of human civilization.

Prehistory was a period of human existence that is not recorded by written documents. Instead, archaeologists use physical evidence such as stone tools, pottery, and the remains of buildings to reconstruct the lives of our ancient ancestors. It was a time of great change, with the emergence of new technologies, social structures, and ways of living. From the earliest human migrations to the rise of complex societies, prehistory is a story of human ingenuity and adaptability. The past is shrouded in mystery, but archaeological discoveries continue to shed light on the lives of people who lived before the advent of writing. The study of prehistory is a fascinating field that requires patience, observation, and imagination, as researchers piece together the fragments of a long-forgotten past to create a rich and nuanced understanding of human history.  - however, I can make it more readable for a high school level.
