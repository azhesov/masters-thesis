Computer security is a set of processes and practices that help protect digital information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It involves various measures such as firewalls, encryption, secure passwords, and network segmentation to prevent cyber attacks and data breaches. By implementing robust security protocols, organizations can safeguard sensitive data and maintain the integrity of their digital systems. Effective computer security requires ongoing monitoring and maintenance to stay ahead of evolving threats and vulnerabilities. The consequences of inadequate security can be severe, including financial losses, reputational damage, and compromised customer trust. Therefore, prioritizing computer security is essential for individuals and organizations alike.
