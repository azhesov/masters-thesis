Computer security, also known as information security, is like a fortress protecting your digital world. Imagine your computer is a castle, and all your personal data - like family photos, passwords, and important documents - are precious treasures stored inside. Now, computer security is the guard, the walls, and the moats that keep these treasures safe. It's like having a strong password that's hard to guess, like a complex lock on your castle's gate. It's also like having up-to-date software, similar to maintaining the walls and towers of your castle, ensuring they're always in good repair to defend against any attacks. Furthermore, it's about being cautious when clicking on links or downloading files, much like being wary of strangers approaching your castle. Lastly, it's about having a plan B, like a secret escape route in case intruders breach your defenses. This plan B could be regular backups of your data, ensuring your treasures are safe even if your computer is compromised.",10.2,53.51,12.6,13.2,12.05,12.12,5.33,9.0
