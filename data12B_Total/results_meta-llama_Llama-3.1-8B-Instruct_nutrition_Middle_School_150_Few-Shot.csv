In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

The kitchen is where healthy food is prepared for our families. If we eat a balanced diet, our bodies will thank us. What does that mean? A balanced diet is one that includes foods from all four food groups: fruits and vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. The food groups are like friends who all work together to keep our bodies strong and healthy. Fruits and vegetables help us fight off sicknesses, while whole grains give us the energy to run and play. Lean proteins help build strong muscles, and healthy fats keep our hearts beating. When we eat a variety of foods from all four groups, our bodies get all the nutrients they need to function properly. So, let's make a conscious effort to include all four food groups in our meals. Our bodies will thank us! We will be strong, healthy, and happy!

When food is consumed, it gets broken down into smaller parts by the digestive system. This process, called digestion, begins in the mouth where teeth and saliva start to break down the food. The food then moves into the stomach where stomach acid and enzymes further break it down. The partially digested food, now called chyme, is then moved into the small intestine where nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream. The remaining waste, called feces, moves into the large intestine where it is stored until it is eliminated from the body. Proper nutrition is essential for the body to function correctly, as it provides the necessary energy and building blocks for growth and repair. A well-balanced diet rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins is crucial for maintaining good health.

The nutritious meal was prepared with ingredients of varied backgrounds. The chicken, which had escaped from the farm, said, 'I once lived a life of freedom, roaming in the fields and eating the tastiest plants.' The vegetables, which were picked from the garden, added, 'We too have escaped our usual fate of being eaten in their raw state. If we were left in the garden, we would be consumed by pests and diseases.' The grains, which were cultivated in the fertile soil, joined in, 'And I, like my friends, would have been wasted without proper care, if I was left to rot in the fields.'

The nutritionist, who carefully prepared the meal, said, 'This meal is a perfect blend of nutrients and flavors. Each ingredient has been carefully selected and prepared to provide the best possible outcome.' The meal was then consumed, and its benefits were felt throughout the body. The nutrients were absorbed, and the body was nourished. The meal was a success",7.9,75.64,10.1,9.2,9.99,7.6,4.85,11.0

Fats and oils are especially important because they help sustain our bodies. They are like the straw that helped keep the beans and coal safe from the fire. If we don't have enough fats, our energy can be burnt up, leaving us feeling weak and tired. The right amount of sugar is also essential, as it helps our bodies work properly.

Nutrition is a vital part of a person's life. When we eat, our body uses the food to get the energy it needs to function. Just like a car needs gasoline to run, our body needs food to keep us going. But, if we eat too much of the wrong foods, it can be like a car running on bad gasoline - it won't work properly. Our body needs a balance of different nutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats to keep us healthy. If we don't get enough of these nutrients, we can feel weak and tired. Just like the old woman who lost her bean, if we don't eat right, we can lose out on the benefits of good nutrition. So, let's make sure to eat a healthy, balanced diet to keep our body running smoothly.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat.

When you take in food, it travels down your throat, through the esophagus, and into your stomach. The stomach is like a big bag that chews up the food with its strong muscles. It mixes the food with special juices that break down the food into tiny pieces. The broken-down food then passes into the small intestine, where the nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream. The bloodstream carries these nutrients to all parts of the body. It's like a delivery system, bringing the necessary ingredients for growth and repair. If the nutrients are absorbed properly, the body will function well. If not, it may become weak or sick. Proper nutrition is essential for maintaining a healthy body. So, take care to eat foods that provide the necessary nutrients for your body to thrive.

Carefully selected ingredients, a delicate balance of flavors, and precise preparation are all crucial elements in creating a culinary masterpiece. In the same way, our daily sustenance requires a harmonious blend of essential components to function optimally. A balanced mix of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats provides the necessary building blocks for growth and maintenance. These complex molecules are absorbed and utilized by the body, allowing it to perform its various functions efficiently. Just as a skilled chef must carefully measure and combine ingredients to achieve the perfect dish, our internal mechanisms must be in perfect harmony to ensure our sustenance is properly utilized. A perfect balance is key to optimal functioning, just as a masterfully prepared meal is key to a satisfying dining experience.

A better fate is to eat foods that are good for us, like fruits and vegetables, which can help us grow strong and healthy. But what if we didn’t eat these foods?
