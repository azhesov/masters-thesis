Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and other objects in space. It uses math and physics to explain how these objects move and interact. Astronomers observe space using special tools like telescopes. They look at light from distant stars and galaxies to learn more about the universe. This helps us understand our place in the cosmos and how the universe works. Astronomy also inspires us to explore and discover new things. It's like a big puzzle where we keep finding new pieces to help us see the whole picture.",6.7,68.06,8.2,8.8,6.97,9.49,4.15,5.666666666666667
