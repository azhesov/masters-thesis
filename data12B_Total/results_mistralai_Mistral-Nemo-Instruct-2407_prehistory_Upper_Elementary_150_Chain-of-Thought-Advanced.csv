**Final Paragraph:**
""Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down, so we call it 'before history'. It started when humans first appeared on Earth, about 3 million years ago, and ended when people in different parts of the world began writing about their lives. This time period is very important because it helps us understand how humans lived and how they changed over thousands of years. We learn about this time by studying things like tools, art, and buildings that people made, as well as bones and plants they used. This is called archaeology.""

2. Mention that it includes the lives of early humans.
3. Use simple past tense to describe the activities of these early humans.
4. Use transition words to connect ideas.
5. Use simple, short sentences to target the desired Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level.

Output:

**150 words:**
Prehistory refers to the time before written records. It began with the first humans and ended when people started writing things down, around 3,400 years ago in Mesopotamia. During prehistory, humans used tools and had simple societies. They were hunters, gatherers, and farmers. They made art, like paintings in caves. They also had beliefs and rituals. Prehistory ended as people started to write about their lives and history.
