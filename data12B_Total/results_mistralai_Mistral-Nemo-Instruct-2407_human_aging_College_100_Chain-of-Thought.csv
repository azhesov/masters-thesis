Human aging, a complex biological process, is characterized by progressive changes in various physiological systems. Over time, our bodies accumulate molecular damage, leading to a decline in cellular function. This is primarily due to the relentless passage of time and the inevitable accumulation of damage from the wear and tear of daily life, often referred to as the ""clock"" and ""damage"" theories of aging, respectively. Additionally, the gradual loss of stem cells, which are responsible for replenishing and repairing tissues, contributes significantly to the aging process. Lastly, the role of inflammation, a normal immune response, becomes increasingly problematic in older individuals, as it often becomes chronic and damages healthy tissues, a phenomenon known as ""inflammaging.""",12.7,36.18,13.8,13.2,14.11,13.45,6.19,8.0

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. Here is an example of a paragraph that I wrote:
""Human aging is a complex, multi-faceted process characterized by a progressive decline in physiological function over time. It's a natural, inevitable part of life, influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetic predisposition, and extrinsic factors, like environmental conditions and lifestyle choices. As we age, our cells and tissues accumulate damage, leading to a decline in their function and an increased risk of age-related diseases. This decline is not linear and varies among individuals, reflecting the intricate interplay of factors contributing to the aging process.""",11.8,44.03,13.8,13.3,13.89,13.46,6.17,11.0
