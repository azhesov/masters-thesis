The prehistory of human beings begins from the emergence of the genus Homo, and ends before the advent of written records, i.e. before the invention of writing. It covers the period from the earliest human-like species, like Australopithecus afarensis, to the invention of writing, which was a crucial step in the development of civilization. Prehistory can be further divided into three periods: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), the Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and the Neolithic (New Stone Age). During this period, humans developed various tools, such as stone tools, and started to domesticate plants and animals. They also developed language and social structures, which laid the foundation for the emergence of complex societies.
