**Plan:**

1. ""Prehistory"" refers to the time before written records.
2. It spans from the beginning of human life to the invention of writing.
3. Prehistory is divided into several periods based on technology and culture.
4. These periods include the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.
5. Archaeologists study these periods using artifacts and other evidence.

**Paragraph:**

""Prehistory, the time before writing, stretches from humans' start until scripts appeared. It's split into eras by technology and culture, like the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Archaeologists, using artifacts and other clues, study these periods.""

**Prehistory** is the time before history, when no written records were kept. This period began when the first humans appeared around 2.6 million years ago and ended about 5,000 years ago. During prehistory, humans were hunters and gatherers, living in small groups called tribes. They used stone tools and had no permanent homes. Prehistory ended when humans started to farm and create written records.

This period stretches from the emergence of the first humans around 3 million years ago to the advent of writing, approximately 5,000 years ago. Due to the lack of written sources, our understanding of this era relies heavily on archaeological findings and scientific theories. Prehistory encompasses the evolution of human ancestors, such as Homo habilis and Homo erectus, and their migration across various continents.""",9.5,49.92,10.1,11.7,10.4,11.3,4.74,5.2

**Plan:**
- Use simple, familiar terms for prehistoric times.
- Explain that it's before history.
- Use examples like 'cavemen' and 'dinosaurs'.
- Keep sentences short and simple.
- Use active voice.

**Paragraph:**

""Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down. It's like when cavemen lived. They didn't have books or computers. They used tools made from stones or bones. Dinosaurs lived during this time too. We learn about prehistory from fossils and paintings in caves. It's a long time ago, but we can still learn about it today.""
