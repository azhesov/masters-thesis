Computer security, also known as cybersecurity, is like a strong fence around your digital house. It protects your important information, like passwords and private messages, from bad guys who want to steal or harm it. This fence has many parts, like locks (strong passwords), guards (antivirus software), and cameras (firewalls) that watch for any trouble. Just like a real house, your digital one needs regular check-ups to make sure everything is working well. So, always update your security tools and be careful when you share your personal information online.
