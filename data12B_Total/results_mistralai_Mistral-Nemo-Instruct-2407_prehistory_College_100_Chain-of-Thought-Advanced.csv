Prehistory is the time before written records, or history. It started when the first humans appeared on Earth, around 6 million years ago. This period ended when people began writing things down, about 5,000 years ago. Archaeologists study prehistory by examining ancient tools, art, and buildings. These help us understand how early humans lived and evolved.",7.7,60.11,9.7,9.9,7.22,11.23,4.01,5.888888888888889

3. Describe some of the things archaeologists study.
4. Explain that prehistory ends with the invention of writing.

Final paragraph (100 words, Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 13.2):

""Prehistory is the time before written records, studied by archaeologists. They examine artifacts, structures, and fossils to understand how people lived. These include tools, pottery, and buildings. Even animal remains provide clues. Prehistory ends when writing is invented, around 3200 BCE in Mesopotamia.""

Here's the result:

""Prehistory is the period before written records were created. It spans from the beginning of human existence to the development of writing systems, around 3200 BC. During this time, humans evolved, migrated, and created tools and cultures. Archaeologists study prehistory using artifacts and sites, like Stonehenge, to understand early human life.""
