**Plan:**
- Use simple vocabulary and short sentences.
- Explain 'prehistory' as the time before people started writing things down.
- Mention some early humans and what they did.
- Keep the text concise and engaging.

**Paragraph:**
""Prehistory is the time before people could write. It's like going back to the beginning of humans. Imagine early people like Neanderthals. They lived in caves, hunted animals, and made tools from stones. They didn't leave notes, so we study their bones and tools to learn about them. It's like solving a big mystery!""

Plan:
1. Introduce 'prehistory' by explaining that it's a time before history.
2. Mention that it started at the beginning of the universe and ended when writing was invented.
3. Explain that people did not write books or keep records during this time, so we know less about it.
4. Finally, mention that scientists study prehistory using clues from the natural world.

Final Paragraph:
Prehistory is the time before history. It started when the universe began, a very long time ago. It ended when people invented writing. During prehistory, people did not write books or keep records. So, we know less about this time. Scientists study prehistory by finding clues in nature, like fossils and tools made by early humans.
