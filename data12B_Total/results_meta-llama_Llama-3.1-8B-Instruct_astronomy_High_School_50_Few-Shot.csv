Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

There is no specific scientific calculator prescribed for this subject. Any scientific, nonprogrammable calculator is suitable for your studies. Different scientific calculators have different functions and it is up to you to know your calculator. Most scientific calculators have algebraic logic; the operation in an expression can be entered in the calculator in the order in which the expression is read (left to right). The calculator automatically follows the conventional order of operations. 
You can setup your calculator to work either in natural display or linear display. Natural display causes fractions, irrational numbers, expressions, and certain functions to be displayed as you see them on paper. Linear display causes fractions and other expressions to be displayed in a line. 
When we come across an expression such as 7 + 3 ÷ 10 × 1, it makes a difference how we choose which operations to perform first.

When we come across an expression such as 7 + 3 ÷ 10 × 1, it makes a difference how we choose which operations to perform first.
Scientific calculators have been programmed to follow preset mathematical rules. If we press the buttons in a certain order, the calculator does the operations according to the rules that it has been programmed with.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'astronomy' targeting the same readability level (High School), limited to 50 words. 

Astronomy is a subject that explores the universe. It involves the study of stars, planets, galaxies, and other celestial objects. By observing the night sky, astronomers can learn about the properties of these objects and the laws that govern their behavior. Calculators are useful tools in astronomy. 
Note: I have used a simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences to match the readability level of the given examples. Also, I have limited the paragraph to 50 words as per the request. 

Here is a rewritten paragraph with more descriptive language and a few more words to match the style of the example passages:

Astronomy is a captivating subject that delves into the vast expanse of the universe, probing the mysteries of stars, planets, galaxies, and other celestial wonders. By gazing up at the starry night sky, astronomers can gain valuable insights into the properties of these enigmatic objects and the laws that govern their behavior.

Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.
