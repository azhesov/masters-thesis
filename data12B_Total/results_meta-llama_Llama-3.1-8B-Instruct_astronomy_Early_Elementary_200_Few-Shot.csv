warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.

In the night sky, there are stars and planets. We can see them with our eyes. But we can’t see them very well. That is because we are on Earth, and they are very far away. To see them better, we need to use a telescope. A telescope helps us see the stars and planets more clearly. We can see the moon with a telescope too. It looks big and round. We can also see the sun with a telescope, but we have to be very careful. The sun is very hot and can hurt our eyes. So, we need to wear special glasses to look at it safely. Astronomers use telescopes to learn more about the stars and planets. They want to know where they came from and what they are made of. They also want to know if there are other planets like Earth. By using telescopes, astronomers can answer these questions and learn more about the universe.

Astronomy is the study of the stars and the world. People do astronomy to learn about the world. We live on a big ball called Earth. Earth is in space. Space is full of stars. The stars shine at night. Sometimes we see a shooting star. That is a rock that is burning. The rock is burning because it is close to the Sun. The Sun is a big ball of fire. It makes our world warm. We have a moon that goes around the Earth. The moon has no fire. It is a cold rock. We can see the moon in the sky at night. We can see the stars in the sky too. People use special machines to see the stars and the world. They are called telescopes. Telescopes help us learn about the world. We can use telescopes to see the moon and the stars.

Astronomy is the study of the stars. Stars are big balls of fire in the sky. There are many stars. We can’t walk to the stars, but we can see them from Earth. We can see the Sun, the Moon, and the stars at night. The stars shine brightly. But some stars shine more than others. The stars that shine brightly are called big stars. Big stars are very far away. They are far away that even a spaceship can’t go to them. A spaceship is a machine that goes up high in the air. It can go to the Moon, but it can’t go to the big stars.

Astronomy is the study of the stars, planets, and the universe. Many people like to look at the night sky. They see the moon and the stars twinkling. The stars are like big balls of fire in the sky. They give us light. The planets are like big rocks that go around the Sun. The Sun is like a big ball of fire too. It gives us light and heat. But the planets are much, much farther away from the Sun than the Earth is. The Earth is like a big rock that goes around the Sun too. It's where we live. We can see the Sun, the moon, and the stars from the Earth. But the Sun is so big that it covers up the light from the stars. That's why we can't see them during the day.

Astronomy is the study of the universe. It is the study of stars, planets, and galaxies. People who study astronomy want to know more about the universe. They want to know how the universe began. They want to know what it is made of. They want to know how big it is. There are many ways to study the universe. Some people use telescopes. Telescopes help us see far away. They help us see things that are very small. Some people use computers. Computers help us learn about the universe. They help us make pictures of the universe. Some people even go to space. They go to space to learn more about the universe. They go to space to see new things. They go to space to explore. There are many things we do not know about the universe. But we will learn more about the universe by studying it. We will learn more about the universe by using telescopes, computers, and by going to space. We will learn",1.6,97.5,1.8,6.2,4.12,2.97,2.44,2.1875

Astronomy is the study of the universe. People who study astronomy look up at the stars and the Moon. They ask questions like, ""How far away are the stars?"" or ""How many stars are there?"" They use big machines to look at the stars and the Moon. These machines can see things that are too far away to see with our eyes. One of these machines is called a telescope. Astronomers also use computers to help them. They can use the computers to show pictures of the stars and the Moon. Some astronomers go to space to study the stars and the Moon. They go up in a rocket and stay up there for a while. When they come back, they tell us what they saw. Then we can learn about the universe and how big it is.

**Additional notes**

- Keep the paragraph short and simple.
- Use vocabulary from astronomy that is accessible to the target age group.
- Use a clear and logical structure.
- Use active voice as much",1.8,96.99,2.1,6.5,4.47,3.15,2.56,2.1875

Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and galaxies. It helps us understand the universe and how things move in space. Some things in space are very big. The Sun is a star. It shines light on Earth. The Earth is a planet. It goes around the Sun. The Moon is another object in space. It goes around the Earth. Some things in space are very small. Comets are tiny objects that shine in the sky. They are made of ice and rock. They melt when they get close to the Sun. A telescope is a tool used to study objects in space. It helps us see things that are far away. Astronomers are people who study the universe. They use telescopes to learn about stars, planets, and galaxies. They want to know how the universe began and how it will end. They also want to know if there are other life forms in space. Astronomers are curious people who want to learn more about the universe.",1.6,97.4,1.7,6.2,4.16,2.8,2.48,2.1875

Astronomy is a study about the sky. We can see many things in the sky. But what is the sky? The sky is made of air. The air is made up of many small things called molecules. These molecules move around. They move around because of the Sun’s heat. The Sun’s heat makes the air warm. The warm air rises. That’s why we can see the sky. We see the sky because the warm air moves away from the Sun. The air moves away from the Sun because the Sun’s heat makes it rise. There are many things in the sky. We can see stars, planets, and the Moon. We can even see comets. These are things that are made of ice. When they get close to the Sun, they melt. They melt because the Sun’s heat makes them warm. The warm ice melts into the Sun’s heat. The melted ice turns into gas. This gas makes a beautiful tail that we can see in the sky",1.6,97.5,1.2,6.0,4.05,2.22,2.37,2.1875
