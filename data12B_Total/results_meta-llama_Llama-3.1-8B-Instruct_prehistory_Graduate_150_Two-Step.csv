Prehistory is the period of human history before the advent of written records. It spans from the emergence of the first humans, around 300,000 years ago, to the invention of writing, around 5,000 years ago. The prehistoric era is typically divided into several distinct periods, each marked by significant technological, cultural, or environmental changes.

The Paleolithic Era, which lasted from 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago, saw the development of early stone tools and the emergence of modern humans. The Mesolithic Era, which followed, saw the introduction of more sophisticated tools and the expansion of human populations. The Neolithic Era, which began around 10,000 years ago, marked the transition to settled agriculture and the emergence of complex societies.
