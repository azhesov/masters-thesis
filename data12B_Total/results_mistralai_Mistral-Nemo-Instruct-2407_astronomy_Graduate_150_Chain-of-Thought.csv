Astronomy, the scientific discipline dedicated to the observation and study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere, encompasses a vast realm of exploration. At its core, astronomy is the investigation of the universe, a boundless expanse that includes galaxies, each a vast collection of stars, planets, and other celestial bodies held together by gravity. Within this cosmic expanse, astronomers study the life cycle of stars, from their birth as massive clouds of gas and dust to their demise as supernovae or black holes. They also explore the formation and evolution of planets, their moons, and other celestial bodies within our solar system and beyond. Through advanced observation techniques, such as spectroscopy and interferometry, astronomers gather data from telescopes on Earth and in space",11.0,45.96,13.4,13.0,12.56,13.57,5.77,8.0
