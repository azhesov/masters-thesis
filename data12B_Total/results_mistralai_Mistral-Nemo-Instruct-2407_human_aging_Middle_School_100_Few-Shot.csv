In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

Human aging is like cooking beans. Just as the old woman lit a fire to cook her beans, time sets the stage for our lives. Instead of a handful of straw, it's our body's energy that ignites our days. Like the beans, we grow and change. Some parts of us might ""pop"" like the bean that dropped, showing signs of age. But like the straw, we too can dry out and eventually, like the coal, burn out. Yet, our experiences, our ""cooking,"" shape us, making us unique, just as each bean becomes a special part of the dish.",7.7,76.15,9.1,8.2,9.33,6.67,4.58,11.0

It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Human aging is an inevitable process, much like the beans turning into broth. It happens gradually, just as the straw catches fire bit by bit. As we age, our hair turns grey, like the coal leaping from the fire. Wrinkles appear on our skin, and it sags, similar to the bean's fate in the pan. Our strength may fade, but with proper care and understanding, like the hot air drying the veneer, we can age gracefully.",8.1,75.24,10.1,8.7,9.91,7.31,4.89,11.0

Human aging is like a slow fire that gradually consumes a person. Just as a bean escapes the pan, humans strive to avoid the effects of aging. Yet, like the straw, aging is inevitable, eventually burning through our youth and vigor.",8.2,74.93,9.9,8.6,9.96,6.96,4.94,11.0

As the years go by, a person's body and mind change. Hair can turn gray, and wrinkles appear on the skin. Muscles may become weaker, and bones might get brittle. Some people's eyesight or hearing may worsen. The brain can also slow down, making it harder to remember things or learn new ones. These changes are a normal part of growing older.",7.6,76.45,9.1,8.0,9.08,6.91,4.68,11.0
