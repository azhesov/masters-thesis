Write a summary about 'nutrition'. Limit the output to 150 words. 'Nutrition' refers to the process by which organisms consume food and use it for growth, maintenance, and repair. It involves the intake of essential nutrients - proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals - which are vital for numerous physiological functions. Adequate nutrition promotes overall health, boosts immunity, and enhances physical and cognitive performance. Conversely, poor nutrition can lead to various health issues, such as obesity, diabetes, and nutrient deficiencies, which may culminate in severe diseases like osteoporosis or scurvy. Therefore, balanced and diverse nutrition is crucial for well-being and quality of life.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 150 words:
