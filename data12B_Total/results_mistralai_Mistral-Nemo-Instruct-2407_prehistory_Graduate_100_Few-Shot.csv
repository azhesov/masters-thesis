Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Prehistory, from the Greek 'protos' (first) and 'historia' (history), is the scholarly study of human life before the advent of written records. Archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians delve into this era, reconstructing past cultures through artifacts, oral traditions, and environmental evidence. As written language had not yet emerged, understanding prehistory requires inferring past human behavior and culture from material remnants. This period, spanning from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing, varies in length and content across different regions and cultures.",15.4,34.6,18.7,16.6,17.08,14.1,7.05,18.0

Prehistoric archaeology is the scholarly and scientific study of human cultures and civilizations that existed before written records. The term prehistory was first used in 1696 in France by French scholar Bernard de Montfaucon. Prehistoric archaeology is studied by scientists, such as archaeologists and anthropologists, as well as historians, who use scientific methods and theories to understand past human cultures and behaviors.",15.6,33.99,18.5,16.8,17.22,13.58,6.99,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 100 words. Prehistory is the period before written records. It is studied by archaeologists and anthropologists, who use material remains and physical features of landscapes to understand past human societies.

Prehistory, a term first coined by French historian Jacques Boucher de Perthes in 1837, refers to the period before written records. Archaeologists and anthropologists, scholars who study human history, delve into this era by examining remnants of material culture and the physical layout of landscapes. Their work sheds light on past societies, their cultures, and interactions, offering valuable insights into human evolution and migration. While not based on direct accounts, prehistory's narrative is crafted through meticulous analysis of tangible artifacts and environmental data, providing a robust understanding of our distant ancestors.",15.1,35.31,18.3,16.7,17.1,14.16,7.04,18.0

Prehistory is the period before recorded history, or the period before the invention of writing.

Prehistory (from the Greek 'prōtē' meaning 'before' and 'historia' meaning 'history'), is the vast expanse of time before the invention of writing. This period, spanning millions of years, encompasses the entire existence of our species, Homo sapiens, except for the recent few thousand years documented by historians. Archaeologists, anthropologists, and other scholars study this era by examining material remains, such as artifacts, fossils, and architectural structures, to understand the lives of our ancient ancestors and their cultural developments.",15.6,33.99,18.6,16.7,17.44,13.94,7.19,18.0
