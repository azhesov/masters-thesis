Prehistory, a term often used interchangeably with 'antediluvian' or 'antediluvian era,' refers to the period in human history that precedes written records. This era spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the advent of writing systems, which occurred independently in various civilizations between 3400 and 3200 BCE. The study of prehistory is primarily based on archaeological evidence, as written records do not exist. Archaeologists examine artifacts, architectural remains, and other physical remnants to reconstruct the lives, cultures, and technological advancements of ancient human societies. This era is further divided into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, each marked by significant technological developments that shaped human history.

Prehistory, a term derived from the Greek words 'pro' meaning before and 'historia' meaning history, refers to the period before written records. It encompasses the entirety of human existence, spanning from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago until the invention of writing systems, which occurred independently in various civilizations between 3400 BCE in Sumeria and 1200 BCE in China. This era is marked by significant developments in human culture and technology, including the control of fire, the domestication of plants and animals, the creation of art and architecture, and the evolution of language. Understanding prehistory is crucial for grasping the foundations of human civilization and the complex processes that have shaped our species' trajectory.

**Prehistory**, a term derived from the Greek 'pro' meaning before and 'historia' meaning history, refers to the period of time before written records were created. This era spans from the origins of the universe, through the formation of the Earth and the emergence of life, up to the advent of written language and civilizations. It encompasses a vast expanse of time, approximately 4.6 billion years, during which the planet underwent significant geological, biological, and ecological transformations. Prehistory is often divided into eons, eras, periods, and epochs, each marked by distinct characteristics and events. The study of this period, known as prehistoric archaeology, relies heavily on physical evidence such as fossils, artifacts, and architectural remnants, as well as scientific methods like geochronology and paleoclimatology to reconstruct and understand human history before the advent of writing.",12.6,36.39,14.3,14.1,14.09,14.15,5.72,10.166666666666666

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 200 words that follows your plan. Remember to include a reference to the first paragraph of the textbook. The textbook's first paragraph is: ""The archaeological record reveals that humans have been shaping their environment for more than 10,000 years. This process, called domestication, involved a shift from a hunter-gatherer lifestyle to a more sedentary one based on agriculture. However, the roots of this transformation go back much further, to a time before written records, before the invention of agriculture, and before the emergence of Homo sapiens. This period, known as prehistory, spans the millions of years of human evolution and the development of the various hominin species that preceded us.""

Prehistory, a term derived from the Greek words 'pre' meaning before and 'history' meaning narrative, refers to the time period before the invention of writing. This era spans from the emergence of the earliest human ancestors around 6 million years ago until the development of written records, varying by culture but typically around 3000 BCE. Archaeologists, scientists who study human history through the analysis of physical remains, are the primary investigators of prehistory. They utilize a multitude of methods, including the excavation of artifacts and structures, the examination of environmental data like pollen and sediments, and the study of human remains to reconstruct the lives of our ancestors. By studying prehistory, archaeologists can uncover a wealth of information about early human societies, their technologies, cultural practices, social structures, and interactions with their environments.
