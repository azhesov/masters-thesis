In the time before written history, people lived and worked without leaving many records. This period is called prehistory. During this time, people used tools made from stones, bones, and other natural materials. They learned to make fires and cook food. They also created art on cave walls. Over time, they learned to farm and raise animals. This helped them stay in one place and build communities. But, we don't know much about these early people because they didn't write things down. Archaeologists study their tools and other artifacts to learn more about how they lived.",6.1,69.48,8.2,9.8,9.08,10.41,3.58,5.4

Prehistory is the time before written history, which began around 3000 BCE in ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia. People living in prehistory relied on oral traditions to pass down stories and knowledge. They used tools made from bone, stone, and wood. Life was focused on survival, hunting, gathering, and farming. Humans lived in small groups, often moving around to find food and resources. Prehistoric people made art, like cave paintings, which are some of the oldest known forms of human expression. Archaeologists study the remains of these early humans to learn about their lives.",8.0,59.09,10.6,10.3,9.24,12.75,4.67,6.111111111111111

In prehistory, people lived before we had writing. That was a long time ago, around 3 million years back. These early humans didn't use money or cities. They were nomads, moving around to find food.

Prehistory is the time before written records, when humans and their ancestors lived as hunters and gatherers.

In the past, before people started writing things down, there was a time called prehistory. During this period, people lived as hunters and gatherers, meaning they found food by hunting animals and collecting plants. They didn't have cities or buildings like we do today. Instead, they lived in small groups called tribes and made their homes from natural materials like wood and animal hides. To communicate, they used pictures, sounds, and gestures.

Prehistory refers to the time before written records were kept. It's like going back to the beginning of human history, but without any books, letters, or signs to help us understand what happened. Archaeologists, who are like detectives, use clues like tools, paintings, and fossils to piece together stories from this distant past. They study periods like the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, each named for the main materials people used to make tools and weapons. Life was quite different then, with people living as hunters and gatherers, depending on nature for their food and shelter.

Prehistory is the time before written records. It covers the period from the earliest humans to when people began writing. This time is divided into Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Each age is named after the most commonly used material. During the Stone Age, people used stones for tools. The Bronze Age started when people learned to make bronze. Bronze is a mix of copper and tin. It's stronger than stone but softer than iron. The Iron Age began when people discovered iron. Iron is the strongest of the three. These ages show how humans have used different materials over time to create better tools and change how they lived.",6.0,69.89,6.6,9.1,7.99,8.73,3.7,4.545454545454546
