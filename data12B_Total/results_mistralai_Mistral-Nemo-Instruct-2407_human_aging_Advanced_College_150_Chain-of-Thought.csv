Human aging, a universal and irreversible biological process, is characterized by progressive functional decline and increased vulnerability to diseases and death. At the cellular level, aging is marked by telomere attrition, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These cellular and molecular changes accumulate over time, contributing to organ dysfunction and age-related pathologies. Theories of aging, such as the free radical theory and the Hayflick limit, attempt to explain these changes. Additionally, lifestyle factors like diet, exercise, and stress can modulate the aging process. Understanding the complex mechanisms underlying human aging is crucial for developing interventions to promote healthy aging and extend healthspan.",12.6,31.07,14.6,13.8,14.84,16.23,6.12,10.714285714285714

Human aging, a complex, multifaceted process that occurs at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels, is characterized by a progressive decline in physiological functions, increased vulnerability to diseases, and ultimately, death. This intricate process is influenced by a combination of intrinsic factors, such as genetic predispositions and programmed cellular senescence, and extrinsic factors, including environmental stressors and stochastic events. The telomere hypothesis of aging, proposed by Leonard Hayflick and Alexey Olovnikov, suggests that the progressive shortening of telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes, with each cell division contributes to aging. Additionally, the accumulation of molecular damage, such as oxidative stress and epigenetic modifications, plays a significant role in the aging process. Furthermore, cellular senescence, the irreversible arrest of cell division, contributes to aging by secreting pro-inflammatory factors that disrupt tissue homeostasis. The study of aging is a dynamic and rapidly evolving field, with ongoing research aiming to elucidate the underlying mechanisms and",14.4,26.4,17.5,15.8,16.63,17.58,6.9,12.0

Human aging, a complex biological process, is characterized by the progressive decline in physiological functions, leading to an increased susceptibility to diseases and ultimately, death. This multifaceted process is influenced by a combination of intrinsic factors, such as genetics, and extrinsic factors, like environmental stressors. Telomere shortening, a key marker of cellular aging, occurs as cells divide, and is thought to contribute to age-related diseases. Additionally, the accumulation of molecular damage due to reactive oxygen species (ROS) and other free radicals plays a significant role in aging. Theories such as the ""free radical theory of aging"" and the ""genetic theory of aging"" attempt to explain these phenomena. However, it is essential to note that the aging process is not solely linear and deterministic, but also dynamic and influenced by various stochastic and adaptive processes.",12.7,36.08,14.2,14.7,15.41,14.21,6.29,8.857142857142858
