Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 150 words. 
Prehistory is the period before recorded history, from the emergence of the first humans to the beginning of written records. It is divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During the Paleolithic period, early humans developed tools and adapted to different environments. The Mesolithic period saw the development of more complex societies and the use of more sophisticated tools. The Neolithic period is characterized by the domestication of plants and animals, which led to the development of settled agriculture and the rise of complex societies. Prehistory is also marked by the emergence of early civilizations, such as ancient Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Indus Valley Civilization. The study of prehistory relies on archaeological evidence, such as artifacts, architecture, and other remains that have survived from the past. It provides a window into the lives of our ancestors and helps us understand how human societies developed over time. Posted in: Prehistory, Summary Email This BlogThis!

## Step 1: Identify the main topics to be included in the summary
The main topics to be included in the summary are the definition of prehistory, the three main periods of prehistory (Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic), the key characteristics of each period, and the importance of prehistory in understanding human societies.

## Step 2: Simplify the definition of prehistory
Prehistory is the time before people could write things down. It started with the first humans and ended when people began to keep written records.

## Step 3: Describe the three main periods of prehistory
The first period, Paleolithic, is when early humans developed tools and learned to adapt to different environments. The second period, Mesolithic, saw the development of more complex societies and better tools. The third period, Neolithic, is when people started to grow their own food and raise animals.

**A Long Time Ago: The Prehistoric Era**

A long time ago, before people kept written records, there was a time called prehistory. It started about 2.5 million years ago with the first humans and lasted until about 5,000 years ago when writing was invented. During this time, people lived in small groups and moved around. As time passed, these groups grew and became more complex, forming bigger societies that settled in one place. The prehistoric era is divided into three main parts: the Stone Age, the New Stone Age, and the Farming Age. Each of these eras saw big changes in tools, technology, and how people lived together. We know about the prehistoric era by studying old artifacts, fossils, and other things that were left behind. These clues help us learn about",9.3,55.74,10.8,12.1,9.49,11.54,4.41,8.857142857142858

Prehistory is typically divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). During these periods, humans developed tools, languages, and social structures, and eventually transitioned from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled agricultural communities. The study of prehistory relies heavily on archaeological evidence, including artifacts, fossils, and other material remains that provide clues about the lives and cultures of early humans. By studying prehistory, researchers can gain insights into the origins of human civilization, the development of culture, and the evolution of human societies.

Here is a summary of prehistory rewritten for an upper elementary level audience and limited to 150 words:

Prehistory is a long, long time ago - before we had writing. It's a time when humans first appeared on Earth and began to live and work together. Prehistory is broken into three main parts: the Old Stone Age, the Middle Stone Age, and the New Stone Age. During these times, people learned how to make tools, speak languages, and create societies. They started to live in one place and grow food instead of moving around and hunting for food. Archaeologists study old artifacts, like tools and fossils, to learn about how people lived. By studying prehistory, we can find out how human civilizations started, how people developed their cultures, and how societies changed over time. It's an exciting field of study that helps us understand our ancient ancestors and how they lived.

## Step 1: Define key terms and concepts
To make the text more accessible to upper elementary readers, we need to define key terms and concepts such as ""prehistory,"" ""writing,"" ""archaeological findings,"" and ""radiocarbon dating."" We should also provide a brief explanation of the three main periods of prehistory.

## Step 2: Simplify the language and sentence structure
We should use simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences to make the text easier to understand. We can also break up long sentences into shorter ones.

## Step 3: Remove complex information and details
To limit the output to 150 words, we need to remove some of the complex information and details that may be difficult for upper elementary readers to understand.
