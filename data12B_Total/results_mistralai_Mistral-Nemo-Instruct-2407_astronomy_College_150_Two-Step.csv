Write a summary about 'astronomy'. Limit the output to 150 words. Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere. It involves physics, mathematics, and chemistry to explain the origins and evolution of objects and events in the universe. Astronomy explores a wide range of topics, including stars, galaxies, planets, black holes, and cosmic phenomena like supernovae and gamma-ray bursts. It also studies the universe's large-scale structure, evolution, and fundamental physical properties. Astronomers use a variety of techniques, such as observing the sky, collecting and analyzing data from space-based and ground-based telescopes, and theoretical modeling. Astronomy has significantly contributed to our understanding of the cosmos and continues to push the boundaries of human knowledge.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of College and limit the output to 150 words:
