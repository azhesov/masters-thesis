Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive, multifaceted changes at the molecular, cellular, and organismal levels. It is associated with increased susceptibility to numerous diseases, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. While the exact mechanisms driving aging are not fully understood, theories such as the free radical theory and the telomere hypothesis suggest that oxidative damage and genomic instability contribute to the aging process. Interventions targeting these processes, along with other approaches like caloric restriction and senolytics, show promise in extending healthspan and lifespan in various organisms, including humans.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of College and limit the output to 100 words:

Human aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by progressive functional decline and increased susceptibility to diseases. It's influenced by both intrinsic (genetic, cellular) and extrinsic (environmental, lifestyle) factors. Key aspects include telomere shortening, epigenetic modifications, and cellular senescence, leading to organ deterioration and reduced repair capacity. Aging is also associated with increased inflammation and oxidative stress, contributing to a range of age-related conditions like heart disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders.

Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by progressive physiological changes leading to increased susceptibility to diseases and ultimately, death. It involves various mechanisms, including telomere attrition, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, and stem cell exhaustion. These processes contribute to functional decline in multiple organ systems, impacting mobility, cognition, and overall health.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of College and limit the output to 100 words:

Revised text:
Human aging is a complex process marked by gradual physiological changes that make individuals more prone to diseases and eventually, death. Key mechanisms include telomere shortening, DNA damage, epigenetic changes, protein misfolding, nutrient sensing disruption, mitochondrial decline, and stem cell depletion. These processes lead to functional decline in various organs, affecting mobility, cognition, and overall health. A comprehensive understanding of these mechanisms is vital for creating interventions to prolong health and lifespan.",16.1,11.21,18.6,16.8,16.57,19.6,6.64,14.0
