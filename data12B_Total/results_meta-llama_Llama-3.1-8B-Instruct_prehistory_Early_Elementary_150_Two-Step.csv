Prehistory refers to the period of human history before written records exist. It is divided into three time periods: the Paleolithic (Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age) eras. During the Paleolithic era, early humans developed tools and learned to control fire. The Mesolithic era saw the emergence of more complex societies, while the Neolithic era introduced agriculture and settled communities. Prehistorians study prehistory through archaeological evidence, such as artifacts, fossils, and geological deposits. They also use scientific techniques, such as radiocarbon dating, to determine the age of these findings. Additionally, prehistorians rely on oral traditions and written records from ancient civilizations to supplement their research.

Prehistory is a long time ago, before people wrote down their stories. It's divided into three parts: the Stone Age, the Middle Stone Age, and the New Stone Age. During the Stone Age, people first made tools and learned to use fire. They became better at living together in groups. In the New Stone Age, people grew food and built homes in one place.

The story of human beings before written records is called prehistory. It is the time when humans first appeared in Africa and developed their own ways of life. People used tools, spoke languages, and made their own rules. They also learned to grow their own food and take care of animals. Experts called archaeologists and anthropologists study prehistory. They dig up old places, look at things people left behind, and compare how different people lived. By studying prehistory, we can learn how humans changed and grew over time. This helps us understand how modern societies were created. We can also see how different people lived and what they believed in. Prehistory is a very important subject to learn about our past.

A long, long time ago, there was no writing. This is called prehistory. It started when the first humans appeared and ended when people began writing down their thoughts and stories. During this time, people lived in small groups and made tools to help them survive. As time passed, people started to build homes and communities, and their tools and ways of life changed a lot. Archaeologists and anthropologists study old things like rocks, bones, and pictures to learn about the people who lived a long time ago. By studying the past, we can learn about how humans lived and how the world changed. We can also see how people worked together and how they used the world around them.

Prehistory is a long time ago, before people could write. We don't have any written records from that time. But we can learn about it by studying things that people left behind. These things are called artifacts. We can also learn from pictures and objects that were made a long time ago. Prehistory is divided into three main periods. The first one is the Paleolithic period. This is when the first humans appeared. They made simple tools from stones. The next period is the Mesolithic period. People made more complicated tools and started living in groups. The third period is the Neolithic period. People started growing their own food and living in villages. By studying prehistory, we can learn about our ancestors and how human society developed over time. It's a fascinating way to learn about the past!

A long time ago, before we had written records, people lived in a time called prehistory. This time is divided into three parts: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During the Paleolithic era, people used stone tools and hunted for food. They moved around a lot and didn't live in one place. In the Mesolithic era, people made better tools and started to live in one place. They grew their own food and started to make things like art. In the Neolithic era, people started to farm and take care of animals. They made more complicated societies and traded with each other. This time is important because it helps us understand how people lived a long time ago and how we got to where we are today.

## Step 1: Simplify the vocabulary
Replace complex words with simpler alternatives to make the text more accessible to Early Elementary readers. For example, ""period of human history"" can become ""time in the past when humans lived"".

## Step 2: Shorten the sentences
Early Elementary readers have shorter attention spans, so it's best to keep the sentences short and concise. Break up long sentences into smaller ones.

## Step 3: Use simpler sentence structures
Use basic sentence structures like subject-verb-object to make the text easier to follow.
