Prehistory is the time before written records, spanning from the emergence of humans to the rise of civilizations. Archaeology helps us understand this era by studying material remains like tools, artifacts, and settlements. The Paleolithic era saw hunter-gatherers using simple stone tools, while the Mesolithic marked a transition to more complex societies. The Neolithic brought settled farming and the domestication of plants and animals, leading to the development of agriculture. As humans mastered pottery, metallurgy, and other technologies, civilizations began to form, laying the groundwork for the complex societies we know today. This era paved the way for the recorded history that follows.

Prehistory is the period of time before written records began. This era is often divided into three main stages: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During the Paleolithic era, early humans lived in small groups and survived by hunting and gathering. The Mesolithic era saw the development of more complex societies and the beginning of settled agriculture. The Neolithic era marked the beginning of domestication of animals and the development of more sophisticated tools. Prehistory is significant because it helps us understand how humans evolved and developed complex societies over time. It also provides valuable insights into early human cultures and ways of life.  -- Source:  https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Prehistory  (CC BY-SA 3.0) --
