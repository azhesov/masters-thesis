The human aging process is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that involves the gradual deterioration of physical, mental, and biological functions over time. As people age, their bodies undergo a series of changes that can affect their health, productivity, and overall quality of life. Some of the key characteristics of human aging include: * Telomere shortening: the shortening of telomeres, which are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, leading to cell aging and death. * Epigenetic changes: the alteration of gene expression through environmental and lifestyle factors, which can influence aging and age-related diseases. * Oxidative stress: the accumulation of free radicals, which can damage cells and contribute to aging. * Cellular senescence: the process by which cells become dormant and no longer divide, leading to tissue dysfunction and aging. * Hormonal changes: the decline of hormones such as estrogen and testosterone, which can affect physical and mental health. * Lifestyle factors: the impact of diet,","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 200 words:

Human aging is a complex process that affects people's bodies and minds over time. As we age, our physical and mental abilities start to decline. Some key changes that happen during human aging include: * Telomeres get shorter, which can cause cells to age and die. * Our genes are affected by our environment and lifestyle, which can influence aging and age-related diseases. * Free radicals build up in our cells, damaging them and contributing to aging. * Cells become dormant and stop dividing, leading to tissue dysfunction and aging. * Hormone levels decline, affecting our physical and mental health. * Our lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise, play a big role in how we age and stay healthy.

These changes include a decline in physical strength and flexibility, a decrease in cognitive function, and an increased risk of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's and cancer (Lopez-Otin et al., 2013).

As people age, their bodies undergo changes that can lead to age-related diseases. This natural process affects physical, mental, and emotional functions. Factors like lifestyle, genetics, and environment can influence how quickly someone ages. Research suggests that aging is a complex process involving multiple cellular and molecular mechanisms. One key factor is the buildup of senescent cells, which are no longer able to divide and can contribute to age-related diseases. Understanding aging can help us develop ways to promote healthy aging and prevent age-related diseases. Senolytic therapy, a new approach that targets and eliminates senescent cells, may be a promising way to promote healthy aging. Further research is needed to fully understand the aging process and develop effective interventions. [200 words]

Aging is a complex process that affects how our bodies work over time. As we get older, our bodies undergo changes that can affect our physical and mental abilities. Our bodies' systems, such as the muscles, heart, and brain, can become less efficient, making us more prone to diseases and increasing the risk of death.

Aging is influenced by a combination of factors, including our genes, lifestyle choices, and exposure to toxins. As we age, our cells experience changes that can lead to damage and disease.

Human aging is a complex biological process that affects everyone. It involves a gradual decline in physical and mental abilities, leading to death. Human aging involves various changes at the cellular, biochemical, and molecular levels. These changes include cellular aging, changes in how genes are expressed, and the shortening of the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes. Cellular aging occurs when cells become damaged and can no longer function properly. Changes in gene expression can affect how our bodies age. Shortening of the chromosome caps can cause cells to age faster. Free radicals, which are unstable molecules, can cause oxidative stress, leading to aging. Human aging is influenced by genetics, lifestyle, diet, and exposure to toxins.
