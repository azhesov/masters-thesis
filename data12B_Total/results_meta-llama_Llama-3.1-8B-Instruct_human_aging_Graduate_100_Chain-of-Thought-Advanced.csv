Human aging is the gradual deterioration of physical and cognitive abilities that occurs as individuals grow older. This process is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including lifestyle choices and exposure to disease. Over time, the human body undergoes a series of changes that affect its overall function and structure. These changes can include a decline in muscle mass and strength, a decrease in bone density, and alterations in the brain's ability to process information. As a result, older adults may experience a range of age-related health issues, including chronic diseases and decreased mobility.

The final answer is:
