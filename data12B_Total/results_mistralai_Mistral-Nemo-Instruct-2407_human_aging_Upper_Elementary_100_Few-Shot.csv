As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 100 words. As humans age, they often change in many ways. Their bodies become slower and weaker, and their hair turns gray. But aging is not just about the body. It's also about gaining wisdom. Older people have lived longer and seen more, so they have more knowledge. They can ask questions and give advice. Aging can be a beautiful process, full of growth and learning.",6.6,73.68,7.5,8.8,7.82,7.76,4.11,7.142857142857142
