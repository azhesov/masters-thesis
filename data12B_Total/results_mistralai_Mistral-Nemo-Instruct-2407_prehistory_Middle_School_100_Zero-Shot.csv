Prehistory is the period before written history began. It covers the time when humans first appeared until the invention of writing. This was a time of big changes. Early humans learned to hunt, gather food, and make tools. They also started to live in groups and create art. Prehistory ended differently in various places, depending on when people there started writing. In Egypt, it ended around 3100 BCE, while in some parts of the Americas, it lasted until the arrival of Europeans in the 15th century.",7.7,59.9,8.3,10.5,9.61,10.07,4.46,6.111111111111111

Prehistory is the time before written records, so it's tough to know exactly what happened. Scientists use clues like fossils, tools, and art to learn about our ancestors. They found that humans first appeared in Africa around 2.5 million years ago. Over time, they spread across the globe, adapting to different environments. Early humans were hunters and gatherers, relying on nature for food and shelter.

Prehistory, or the time before we had written words, was a long period when humans first appeared on Earth. We learn about it from tools, art, and fossils. Early humans like Homo sapiens lived in small groups, hunted animals, and gathered plants. They made tools from stones and bones. Some created art on cave walls. Over time, they learned to farm and build cities. This helped us move from prehistory into history, when we started writing things down.",6.7,68.06,7.9,9.6,7.76,9.38,4.03,5.777777777777778
