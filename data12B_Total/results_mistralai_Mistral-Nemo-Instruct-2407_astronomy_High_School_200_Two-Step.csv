Write a summary about 'astronomy'. Limit the output to 200 words. Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects (such as stars, galaxies, planets, and more) and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It involves physics, mathematics, and chemistry. Major branches include astrophysics, cosmology, and planetary science. Astronomy seeks to understand the origin, evolution, and properties of objects in the universe, as well as the laws that govern them. It dates back to ancient civilizations, with significant contributions from ancient Greeks like Ptolemy, and has evolved dramatically with technological advancements like the telescope and space exploration. Today, it's a global endeavor, with major observatories and space agencies collaborating to unravel the mysteries of the universe.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 200 words:
