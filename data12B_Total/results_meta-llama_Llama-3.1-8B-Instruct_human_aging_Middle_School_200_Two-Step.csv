Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. 

Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process that involves the gradual deterioration of physical, cognitive, and biological functions over time. It is a universal phenomenon that affects all living organisms, but its rate and characteristics vary greatly among individuals and species. The aging process is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, including diet, exercise, and exposure to stress and disease.

As people age, their cells undergo a series of changes that can lead to the development of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. The aging process is characterized by the accumulation of cellular damage, including DNA mutations, epigenetic changes, and telomere shortening. This damage can lead to the activation of cellular senescence, a state in which cells become non-functional and contribute to tissue dysfunction.

Human aging is a process that happens over time, where our bodies and minds start to weaken. There are two main reasons why this happens: things that happen inside our bodies and things that happen around us. The things that happen inside our bodies are called intrinsic factors. These include genetics, how our cells work, and how our cells get older. The things that happen around us, like our lifestyle and environment, are called extrinsic factors.

Some scientists think that aging happens because of things like free radicals, which can damage our cells. Others think that it's because our cells get older and can't divide as many times as they used to. When our cells can't divide anymore, they get old",9.9,54.22,12.4,12.5,10.82,12.64,4.88,10.428571428571429

As people age, their bodies change in many ways. These changes can be physical, like wrinkles and gray hair, or functional, like losing strength and flexibility. Our bodies also get damaged over time, making us more likely to get certain diseases like cancer and heart disease. Aging can also affect our brains and emotions, making it harder to remember things and control our feelings. Scientists are still trying to figure out why we age, but they think it's because of a mix of things like our genes, our environment, and the choices we make. Understanding aging is important because it can help us find ways to stay healthy and feel good as we get older.

Here's a rewritten text at a Middle School level, limited to 200 words:

As people get older, their bodies undergo many changes. One of these changes is a decrease in physical strength and energy. The immune system also gets weaker, making it harder for the body to fight off diseases. As a result, older people are more likely to get sick and have chronic diseases. Cells in the body become less efficient and don't divide as quickly as they used to, leading to a loss of muscle and bone mass. This can cause problems with mobility and increase the risk of falls. The brain also gets less efficient with age, which can lead to memory loss and an increased risk of diseases like Alzheimer's. The good news is that there are things we can do to slow down the aging process, such as eating healthy, exercising regularly, and staying away from environmental hazards.
