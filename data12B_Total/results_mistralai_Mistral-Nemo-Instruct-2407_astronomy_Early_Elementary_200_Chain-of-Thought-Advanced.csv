Final Output:
Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and other things in space. It uses special tools to look far into the universe. People have studied astronomy since long ago. Today, we know a lot about space, like how the sun makes heat and light. But there's still much to learn!",5.8,70.39,7.0,8.1,6.06,8.2,3.64,4.9
