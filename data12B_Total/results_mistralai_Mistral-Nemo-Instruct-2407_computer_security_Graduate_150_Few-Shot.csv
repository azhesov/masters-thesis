Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

The term 'computer security' was first used in the 1970s by scientists and engineers to denote the protection of computer systems from harm, damage, or unauthorized access. Physical computer security, a subset of this field, focuses on the prevention of physical theft or damage to hardware. The study of computer security is interdisciplinary, involving computer scientists, cybersecurity specialists, and information security professionals, among others. The goal of computer security is to maintain the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems, a concept known as the CIA triad. Despite its significance, computer security remains an evolving field, with emerging threats and constant advancements in technology necessitating continuous vigilance and adaptation.",15.6,34.09,18.9,17.6,17.93,14.16,7.25,18.0

It involves the implementation of security measures to protect these systems from cyber threats.",15.9,33.38,19.0,17.0,17.98,13.99,7.29,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

The term 'computer security' was first used in 1970, and was defined as protecting computer systems and networks from damage, disruption, or unauthorized access. Today, computer security is a multidisciplinary field, studied by computer scientists, cybersecurity specialists, and information technology professionals. It encompasses principles, policies, and technologies that protect digital data, maintain system integrity, and ensure availability and reliability of computer systems. Effective computer security requires continuous vigilance, as threats evolve and new vulnerabilities are discovered.",15.4,34.49,19.1,17.6,18.26,14.57,7.31,18.0

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 150 words. Computer security (also known as cybersecurity or information assurance) is the protection of computer systems and networks from the theft of or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from the disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. It includes control of physical access to hardware and protection of stored or transmitted data. The term was first used in English in 1970 by the Department of Defense, and later popularized in 1980 by the National Security Agency. Computer security is a multidisciplinary field, studied by computer scientists, engineers, and mathematicians, as well as lawyers and social scientists. It encompasses both technical and non-technical aspects, including policies, procedures, and guidelines for protecting computer systems and data.",15.8,33.48,18.8,17.2,17.87,13.94,7.27,18.0

The term 'computer security' was first coined in 1971 by David Parnas. Computer security, also known as InfoSec or IT security, is the practice of protecting computer systems and networks from digital threats, damage, or unauthorized access. It encompasses a wide range of disciplines, including cryptography, network security, and software security. The study of computer security involves understanding potential vulnerabilities, implementing safeguards to mitigate these risks, and responding to security incidents effectively. Philosophers, computer scientists, and security specialists all contribute to the field, with theories and practices that blend scientific and ethical considerations.",15.2,35.1,18.6,17.5,17.68,14.39,7.11,18.0
