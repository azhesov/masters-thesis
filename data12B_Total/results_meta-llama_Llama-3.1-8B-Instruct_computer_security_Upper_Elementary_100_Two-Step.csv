**Protecting Your Computer and Data**

Computer security is like locking your doors to keep unwanted visitors out. It's the protection of computers and data from people who shouldn't have access. This includes keeping bad programs and viruses from harming your computer. To keep your data safe, we use things like firewalls and encryption. We also teach people how to use computers correctly and update software regularly. The goal is to keep your information private and secure. This is important for everyone, from individuals to big organizations, to protect their digital stuff. 

Note: I made the following changes to match the readability level of Upper Elementary:
- Simplified vocabulary (e.g. ""protection"" instead of ""protection against unauthorized access"")
- Shortened sentences
- Removed technical jargon (e.g. ""malware"", ""intrusion detection systems"")
- Used relatable analogies (e.g. ""locking your doors"")
- Limited the output to 100 words as requested",14.9,14.25,17.3,15.2,13.5,18.9,5.69,11.0
