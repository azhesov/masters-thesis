Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

Prehistory was a time long ago before people started writing down their history. It spanned thousands of years and included different periods like the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. People during this time were called prehistoric humans. They were hunters and gatherers, meaning they found food by hunting animals and gathering plants. They lived in small groups called tribes. They didn't have modern tools or technology, so they made their own tools from stones, bones, and wood. These tools helped them hunt, gather food, and make shelters. Despite not having written records, we know about these times through archaeology. Archaeologists study the remains of these times, like tools, shelters, and even art made by prehistoric humans. This helps us understand how people lived and adapted to their environments during prehistory.",10.3,53.21,11.8,12.8,10.9,11.25,4.92,15.25

Prehistory is a time before people could write down their history. It covers the time when early humans were first spreading across the world. These humans were hunters and gatherers, relying on nature for food and shelter. They didn't have cities or advanced tools like we do today. Instead, they used simple tools made from stone or wood. In this time, people didn't have a way to record their stories or achievements. So, we rely on archaeology and other scientific methods to learn about this period. Archaeologists study the remains of these early societies, like their tools and shelters. They also look at art and other cultural remains. By studying these clues, we can piece together what life was like in prehistory. It's like solving a big puzzle where the pieces are the remains of the past.",10.0,54.02,10.8,12.3,10.24,10.55,4.77,15.25

In this paragraph, include the following key words/phrases: hunter-gatherers, nomads, tool use, stone age, caves, animals, climate change.

In the prehistory of our planet, before recorded history began, people were hunter-gatherers, nomads who moved from place to place, following herds of animals and gathering fruits and vegetables. They lived in the Stone Age, a time when tools were made from stone, bone, and wood. These early humans used simple tools like spears and knives for hunting animals and digging roots. They often lived in caves for shelter, which provided protection from harsh weather conditions and dangerous animals. As the climate changed over thousands of years, these nomads had to adapt to new environments, learning to use new tools and foods to survive. Their way of life was significantly different from ours today, but understanding their story helps us appreciate the resilience and creativity of the human spirit throughout history.",11.5,50.16,13.4,13.9,12.13,11.72,5.42,15.25

Prehistory is the time before written history. The word 'prehistory' is not used in the examples but is a term that could be used in the paragraph.

In the vast expanse of time, before written words marked the passage of years, lies a mysterious realm known as prehistory. This period, shrouded in the mists of time, spans from the dawn of human existence to the invention of writing. It is an era of stone tools, mammoths, and ancient civilizations whose stories are etched only in the sands of time and the echoes of myth. Archaeologists, like detectives, piece together the puzzles of prehistory using clues from the distant past - fossils, artifacts, and the remnants of ancient cultures. These silent witnesses whisper tales of a world both strange and familiar, a time when humans first walked the Earth and began to shape their destiny.",11.4,50.36,12.5,13.4,11.93,10.79,5.32,15.25

Prehistory is a term that refers to the time before history was written down. It is the period that stretches back to the very beginning of human existence on Earth, long before people began recording events and ideas in books. Prehistory is divided into different periods based on the types of tools that people used, the ways they lived, and the changes in climate and environment. One of the earliest periods is the Stone Age, which is split into three parts: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During the Paleolithic, people were hunter-gatherers, relying on nature for survival. They made tools from stone, bone, and wood. The Mesolithic saw the development of more complex tools and a shift towards fishing and gathering. Finally, the Neolithic brought the start of farming and the creation of permanent settlements. These periods mark the progress of human civilization before written records were kept.",10.8,51.89,12.3,13.5,11.7,11.37,5.14,15.25

This era is called the Stone Age, divided into three parts: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. During the Paleolithic, humans were nomadic hunters and gatherers, using stone tools. They lived in caves or simple shelters, surviving off the land. Later, during the Mesolithic, humans began to settle in one place, relying more on fishing and farming. Finally, in the Neolithic, humans developed agriculture and started building permanent structures, marking the end of prehistory and the beginning of history as we know it.",10.8,51.89,12.4,13.7,11.7,11.49,5.22,15.25

Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

There is no specific scientific calculator prescribed for this subject. Any scientific, nonprogrammable calculator is suitable for your studies. Different scientific calculators have different functions and it is up to you to know your calculator. Most scientific calculators have algebraic logic; the operation in an expression can be entered in the calculator in the order in which the expression is read (left to right). The calculator automatically follows the conventional order of operations. 
You can setup your calculator to work either in natural display or linear display. Natural display causes fractions, irrational numbers, expressions, and certain functions to be displayed as you see them on paper. Linear display causes fractions and other expressions to be displayed in a line. 
When we come across an expression such as 7 + 3 ÷ 10 × 1, it makes a difference how we choose which operations to perform first.
Scientific calculators have been programmed to follow preset mathematical rules. If we press the buttons in a certain order, the calculator does the operations according to the rules that it has been programmed with.

Prehistory was a period of time before written records, when humans were hunters and gatherers, living in small groups called tribes. They used tools made of stone, wood, and bone, and their lives were influenced by the environment around them. Prehistoric people were nomadic, moving from place to place in search of food and shelter. They communicated through symbols and art, painting pictures on cave walls to tell stories and record important events. Prehistory ended around 3300 BC, when humans began to develop writing systems and permanent settlements.",11.1,51.07,12.8,13.5,12.01,11.43,5.29,15.25

Prehistory is the period of time before the invention of writing. It started at the beginning of the Stone Age around 3.3 million years ago and ended at the start of history, which varies by culture and place. People in prehistory lived in small groups, hunted for food, and gathered plants. They did not have written language, but they had many ways to communicate. They used signs, gestures, and sounds. They also passed down stories and traditions through generations by telling them out loud. This period of time is important for understanding how human beings lived and evolved before writing was invented.",10.4,52.9,11.4,13.0,11.0,11.02,4.96,15.25

In prehistory, there were no written records, so we can only guess about the people and their lives. Many archaeologists believe that humans lived in small, close-knit groups. These groups were often led by the strongest, most respected man. Life was difficult, with people struggling to find food and shelter. The people in these groups were nomads, moving from place to place in search of resources. They used simple tools made from bone, stone, or wood to hunt animals and gather plants. Despite the challenges, these early humans had a deep connection to nature and understood the importance of living in harmony with their environment.",10.8,51.99,12.0,13.0,11.51,11.14,5.13,15.25
