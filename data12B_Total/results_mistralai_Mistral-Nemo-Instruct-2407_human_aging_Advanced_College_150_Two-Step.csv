Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Humans age due to a combination of intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsic factors include genetic and cellular changes like telomere shortening and DNA damage, leading to cellular senescence and loss of function. Extrinsic factors encompass lifestyle choices and environmental exposures, such as smoking, poor diet, and sun exposure. These factors cause cumulative damage to tissues and organs, contributing to age-related diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Aging is also associated with a decline in physical and cognitive abilities, increased frailty, and an elevated risk of mortality. Understanding the complex mechanisms of aging is crucial for developing interventions to promote healthy aging and extend human lifespan.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 150 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Human aging is a complex process characterized by progressive declines in physiological function and increased risk of disease. It is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetic predisposition, and extrinsic factors like lifestyle and environment. Key aspects include telomere shortening, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, altered intercellular communication, and metabolic reprogramming. These changes contribute to age-related diseases like cardiovascular disease, cancer, and neurodegenerative disorders. Interventions targeting these processes, such as exercise, caloric restriction, and pharmacological approaches, show promise in extending healthspan and lifespan.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 150 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Human aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by progressive, time-dependent decline in physiological functions, increasing susceptibility to diseases, and a rising risk of death. Key hallmarks include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. Theories explaining aging range from evolutionary perspectives, such as the antagonistic pleiotropy theory and disposable soma theory, to cellular and molecular mechanisms like oxidative damage and DNA damage accumulation.

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive physiological and psychological changes over time. It's marked by declines in various aspects of health and function, including strength, cognition, and immune response. Aging is influenced by both intrinsic factors, like genetic predispositions, and extrinsic factors, such as lifestyle and environmental exposures. Theories of aging include the 'free radical theory' suggesting oxidative damage from reactive molecules, and the 'telomere theory' attributing aging to shortening of protective caps on chromosomes. Interventions to slow or prevent aging are an active area of research, with caloric restriction, exercise, and certain drugs showing promise in animal studies. However, human studies are still limited, and there's no proven strategy to significantly extend human lifespan yet.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 150 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. The term 'aging' refers to the collection of physical, psychological, and social changes that occur as an individual grows older. These changes are typically accompanied by a decline in the body's functional abilities, increased risk of various diseases, and a greater susceptibility to injury. The process of aging is influenced by a combination of genetic factors, lifestyle choices, and environmental factors. While some aspects of aging, such as the accumulation of cellular damage over time, are inevitable, many age-related changes can be delayed or even prevented through healthy habits such as regular exercise, a balanced diet, adequate sleep, and avoiding harmful substances like tobacco and excessive alcohol. Regular check-ups and preventive screenings can also help detect and manage age-related health issues early, promoting a better quality of life in older age.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 150 words:
