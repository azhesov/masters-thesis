Prehistory, spanning from the emergence of humans around 6 million years ago to the invention of writing about 5,000 years ago, is a vast period that witnessed significant human evolution and cultural developments. It began with early hominids in Africa, progressed through various Stone Age stages marked by advancements in tool use and technology, and culminated in the Neolithic Revolution, when humans transitioned from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled farming communities. Despite the absence of written records, archaeologists and anthropologists piece together this critical era using evidence from artifacts, fossils, and environmental clues.",15.4,23.77,18.3,16.4,18.25,17.23,7.3,14.6

Prehistory, often referred to as prehistory or prehistory, is the period of human history before the invention of writing. This era spans from the earliest stone tool use by hominids around 3.3 million years ago to the advent of writing systems, which occurred independently in various civilizations between 3400 and 3200 BCE. Prehistory is divided into several key periods, including the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, each marked by distinct technological advancements.
