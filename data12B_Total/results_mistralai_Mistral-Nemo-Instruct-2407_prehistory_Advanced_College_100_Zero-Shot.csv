Prehistory, a term denoting the vast expanse of human history prior to written records, encompasses an array of cultures and civilizations that have left behind tangible remnants but no direct textual accounts. This era, stretching from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing systems circa 3400 BCE, is reconstructed through archaeological findings, linguistic analysis, and anthropological studies. Prehistoric societies, ranging from nomadic hunter-gatherers to complex agricultural communities, offer invaluable insights into early human evolution, technological advancements, and cultural development.",16.0,16.73,19.5,16.6,18.73,19.38,7.92,15.2

Prehistory, the vast expanse of human existence before written records, offers a rich tapestry of archaeological discoveries that illuminate our earliest ancestors' cultural, technological, and biological evolution. This period, spanning from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing roughly 5,000 years ago, is divided into several epochs, each marked by significant shifts in human behavior and adaptation. From the dawn of the Stone Age, when our ancestors first crafted tools from stone, to the emergence of complex societies in the Neolithic era, prehistory provides invaluable insights into humanity's formative years, shaping our understanding of our collective past and our place in the world.",15.6,28.77,18.7,17.6,19.61,15.79,7.6,14.8

Prehistory, encompassing the span from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago until the invention of writing roughly 5,000 years ago, is a period defined by a paucity of written records. Archaeology and anthropology thus become invaluable tools for unraveling the cultural, technological, and social developments of our species during this era. The transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled agriculture, marked by the Neolithic Revolution, is one of the most significant shifts in prehistory, profoundly altering human societies and setting the stage for the civilizations that would follow.",15.3,24.17,17.4,16.2,17.9,16.36,7.07,15.0
