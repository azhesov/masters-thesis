We need food that is good for us, like fruits, vegetables, and whole grains. These foods give us the energy we need to play and have fun. We also need food that has protein, like chicken and fish. Protein helps our bodies grow and fix things when they get hurt. And we need food that has calcium, like milk and cheese. Calcium helps our bones grow strong.

Here's the text: 
You eat food to have energy for your body. Your body uses that energy to play, run, and have fun. The food you eat has special helpers called nutrients. There are different kinds of nutrients, like vitamins and minerals. These helpers keep you healthy and strong. For example, calcium is a mineral that helps your bones grow strong. Iron is a mineral that helps your blood carry oxygen to all your body parts. If you eat a lot of fruits and vegetables, you will get many of these helpers. You can also get them from other foods like milk and whole grain bread. Eating a variety of foods will give you all the helpers you need. That way, your body can stay healthy and strong.

Do you know what nutrition is? Nutrition is what our bodies need to stay healthy and strong. It's like giving our bodies the right food to make them run well. Just like a car needs gasoline to move, our bodies need the right foods to work properly. Fruits, vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins are all good foods for our bodies. They help us grow, heal, and feel happy. When we eat these foods, they give us the energy to play, learn, and have fun. Our bodies also need water to stay healthy. Drinking enough water helps our bodies work properly and feel good. So, remember to eat a variety of foods and drink plenty of water every day to keep your body healthy and strong!
