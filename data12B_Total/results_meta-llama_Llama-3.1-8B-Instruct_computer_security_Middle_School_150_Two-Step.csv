## Step 1: Identify the main concepts in the text
The main concepts in the text are computer security, cybersecurity, protection of computer systems, networks, and sensitive information, malware, viruses, spyware, adware, ransomware, and cyber threats.

## Step 2: Simplify the language and concepts for a Middle School audience
For a Middle School audience, the language and concepts need to be simplified. For example, ""cybersecurity"" can be explained as ""keeping computers and the internet safe from bad people who want to hack into them.""

## Step 3: Break down complex concepts into smaller, more understandable parts
For example, ""authentication"" can be explained as ""verifying that someone is who they say they are"" and ""authorization"" can be explained as ""determining what someone is allowed to do on a computer system.""
