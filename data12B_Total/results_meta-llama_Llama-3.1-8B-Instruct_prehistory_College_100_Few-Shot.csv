Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.

Prehistory is a term that encompasses the time period before written records existed. Prehistory is often divided into several sub-periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic period, also known as the Stone Age, saw the emergence of early human societies. The Mesolithic period, characterized by the use of microliths, marked a transition from a nomadic lifestyle to more settled communities. The Neolithic period, often referred to as the New Stone Age, witnessed the development of agriculture and the rise of complex societies. This period ultimately led to the emergence of civilizations. Prehistory is a broad and complex subject.

Prehistory is a period of time that stretches from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing, usually around 5,000 years ago. During this era, humans did not leave behind written records, making history largely an interpretation of archaeological findings and oral traditions. As a result, the details of prehistory are often incomplete and subject to debate among historians and archaeologists. The term prehistory is often used interchangeably with the term protohistory, however, some historians make a distinction between the two periods. It is the time before recorded history.

Prehistory is a period of time before written records; it is a historical period that includes the development of early human societies. Archaeologists use artifacts and other physical evidence to reconstruct the prehistoric past. The prehistoric period spans from the emergence of the first humans, approximately 200,000 years ago, to the invention of writing, which occurred independently in several regions around 3,500 BCE. The study of prehistory allows us to understand the evolution of early human societies and their development of culture, technology, and governance. It helps us understand the roots of human civilization.

Prehistory is the period in human history that preceded written records.  It is characterized by a lack of written records.  In the prehistoric era, humans and other species interacted with their environment to adapt and survive.  As a result, tools and other artifacts were created and used to achieve these ends.  The term 'prehistory' was first used in the 19th century.  The period is often divided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras, which refer to the use of stone, bone, and pottery tools respectively.  The study of prehistory is an important field of anthropology and archaeology.  The lack of written records does not hinder the study of prehistory.  In fact, the discipline has made significant contributions to our understanding of human evolution and the history of human culture.  Prehistory ended when written records began.  In some cases, the written records may be limited to oral traditions that were later transcribed.",12.3,42.61,13.4,14.4,13.09,12.42,5.6,17.75

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Prehistory is a period in human history which is before written records existed, dating from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of writing. This time period is characterized by the rise and fall of ancient civilizations, the development of tools and technologies, and the emergence of complex societies. Prehistory is not considered a distinct era in the same way as ancient or modern history, but rather a transitional period which laid the groundwork for the development of recorded history. This period is marked by the earliest human artifacts.

Prehistory is the era of human existence that predates written records. This period, often described as a time of discovery and innovation, is characterized by the development of tools, language, and social structures. As a result, humans were able to adapt to their environments, migrate, and interact with one another in complex ways. The prehistoric era is divided into several sub-periods, including the Paleolithic and Neolithic, each marked by significant advancements in technology and societal organization. The term prehistory refers to the time before written records were kept, allowing us to infer and reconstruct the past through archaeological findings.  The prehistoric period is marked by the use of stone tools, language development, and the emergence of complex societies.  Prehistory is the time before written history. This time is marked by the development of early tools, the use of language and the development of early societies. The term prehistory is used to describe the time before written records.
