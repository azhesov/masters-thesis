Here is the step-by-step solution:

Step 1: To explain 'nutrition' in 50 words, I will focus on its basic definition and importance. Nutrition refers to the process of how our bodies get energy and stay healthy. We need food to give us energy to play, grow, and have fun.

Step 2: I will use simple vocabulary like 'play', 'grow', and 'fun' to make it accessible to a 5-year-old. I will also use short sentences to keep it easy to understand. Here's a sample paragraph:
""Nutrition is what our bodies need to stay healthy. We need food to give us energy to play outside. Eating fruits and veggies helps us grow strong.""
