**Final Paragraph:**

Prehistory is the time before people started writing. It starts with the first humans and ends when writing begins. This period is over 3 million years long. During prehistory, people didn't have modern tools or technology. They used simple tools made from stone, wood, and bone. They lived in small groups, hunting animals and gathering plants for food. They also created art, like cave paintings. Archaeologists study this time by finding and examining old tools, bones, and other remains. This helps us understand how early humans lived and how they evolved.",7.2,61.43,9.0,9.3,7.27,10.7,3.82,5.1

Plan:

2. Explain the time period it covers.
3. Describe the lack of written records during this time.
4. Briefly mention what we know about prehistory.
5. End with a sentence about how we study this period.

Writing:

Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down. This period covers many thousands of years, from the first humans until about 3500 years ago when people started recording their history. During prehistory, there were no books, newspapers, or computers to keep records. So, we don't have written stories or news from this time. But, we can still learn about prehistory. Archaeologists study old tools, buildings, and paintings left behind by early humans. They also examine bones and plants to understand how people lived long ago.

Prehistory is the time before written records, when humans had no way to write down their history. It starts with the first humans around 2.6 million years ago and ends with the invention of writing, which varies by culture but was around 3400 BC in Mesopotamia. During this time, people lived as hunters and gatherers, using tools made of stone or bone. They traveled in small groups, following animals or plants for food.

**Output:**

Prehistory is the time before written records. It started when humans first appeared on Earth, about 6 million years ago. During this time, humans did not write books or keep records. They lived as hunters and gatherers, relying on nature for food and shelter. They made tools from stones, bones, and other materials. Over time, they learned to make better tools and use fire. This helped them survive and spread across the world. Archaeologists study prehistory by finding and examining these tools and other artifacts. They also study the bones and remains of animals that lived during this time. By doing this, they can learn about how humans and animals lived long ago.",6.1,69.48,8.1,8.8,7.13,9.72,3.78,4.9
