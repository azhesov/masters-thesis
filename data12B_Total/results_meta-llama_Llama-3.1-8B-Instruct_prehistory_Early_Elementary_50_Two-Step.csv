**Rewritten text:**

Prehistory is a long time ago, before people wrote things down. It started when the first humans appeared, about 5 million years ago, and lasted until writing was invented, around 3,500 years ago. During this time, people made tools, spoke languages, and lived in groups. Archaeologists found old things that tell us about the past. The prehistoric time is divided into parts, each with big changes in how people lived and worked. This time helped create big societies and cities. We learned about farming, taking care of animals, and making better tools. This time saw the start of old civilizations, like ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia. It's an important time in human history.

Long ago, before we had written records, people lived. This was called prehistory. It started about 300,000 years ago in Africa when humans first appeared. During this time, people made tools from rocks and lived in small groups. They also started to grow their own food and build homes.
