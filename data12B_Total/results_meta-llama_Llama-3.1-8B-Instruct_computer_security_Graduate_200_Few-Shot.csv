Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 200 words. Computer security, or infosecurity, is the practice of protecting computing systems from various types of cyber threats. This includes both the prevention of unauthorized access to or use of individual systems and the protection of sensitive information. It is a field of study that is becoming increasingly important, as more and more of our daily lives are being conducted online. The threat of cybercrime is a significant concern for governments, businesses, and individuals alike. A breach of computer security can have serious consequences, including financial loss, damage to reputation, and even physical harm. As a result, computer security is a constantly evolving field, with new threats and vulnerabilities emerging all the time. To stay ahead of these threats, it is essential to implement robust security measures, such as firewalls, encryption, and secure authentication protocols. Additionally, ongoing training and education are crucial to ensure that individuals and organizations have the skills and knowledge necessary to protect themselves from cyber threats. By taking a proactive approach to computer security, we can help to prevent these",14.6,36.63,17.4,16.7,17.13,13.81,6.95,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Computer security (from the Latin ""computare"" and ""secare"" - to cut) refers to the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of computer systems, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities. It is the study of the methods of protecting computers, computer networks, programs, and data from the misuse and malicious actions of individuals, organizations, and nation-states. This field includes the study of threat modeling, vulnerability assessment, penetration testing, incident response, and security protocols.
Computer security is studied by scientists, such as computer security researchers and cryptographers, as well as policymakers, such as politicians and lawyers.
