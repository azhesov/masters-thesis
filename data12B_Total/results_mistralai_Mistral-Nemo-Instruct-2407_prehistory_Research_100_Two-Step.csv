Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 100 words. Prehistory refers to the period before written records, typically extending from the earliest human-like species (around 6 million years ago) until the invention of writing (around 3400 BCE). It's divided into several epochs: Stone Age (Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic), Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Key developments include tool use, control of fire, domestication of plants and animals, and the emergence of complex societies.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Research and limit the output to 100 words:

This era, spanning from the first humans to the invention of writing around 3000 BCE, is divided into three main periods: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Stone Age is further divided into the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). Each period saw significant advancements in technology, culture, and societal organization, from the use of stone tools to the development of agriculture and the creation of permanent settlements.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Research and limit the output to 100 words:
