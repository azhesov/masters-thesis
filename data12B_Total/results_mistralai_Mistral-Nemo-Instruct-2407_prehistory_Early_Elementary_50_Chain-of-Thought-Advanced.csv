Prehistory is the time before written history. It starts with the first humans and ends when people began to write things down. This period covers a very long time, from about 3 million years ago to around 3,000 years ago. People lived as hunters and gatherers, using simple tools. They did not have cities or governments. This time is important for understanding how humans lived and evolved. Archaeologists study prehistory by finding and examining old tools, art, and buildings.
