Step 4: Review and revise your paragraph to ensure it meets the criteria.

Humans age at the cellular level, primarily due to cumulative damage from metabolic processes and DNA replication. Telomeres, protective caps on our chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, limiting replication capacity. Accumulating damage in our DNA and proteins, coupled with impaired cellular repair mechanisms, contributes to aging. This process is linked to increased cancer risk, as damaged cells may become cancerous. Thus, understanding and managing cellular aging is crucial for extending healthy human lifespan.",9.7,49.52,13.2,12.2,12.24,14.2,5.88,7.375

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive physiological changes, increased susceptibility to diseases, and a heightened likelihood of death. It is influenced by a combination of genetic predispositions and environmental factors. This multifaceted phenomenon involves the deterioration of various cellular and molecular processes, including telomere shortening, epigenetic modifications, and accumulation of cellular waste, collectively contributing to the functional decline observed in older adults.

Step 4: Review and edit your paragraph for clarity, accuracy, and conciseness.
Step 5: Ensure the paragraph is written at the Research level and is free of any errors or ambiguities.

Review of the paragraph:
The paragraph effectively explains human aging in a concise and clear manner, using appropriate research-level vocabulary and sentence structure. It provides a comprehensive overview of the topic, touching upon the key aspects of aging, including physiological changes, disease susceptibility, genetic and environmental influences, and cellular and molecular processes involved in aging.
