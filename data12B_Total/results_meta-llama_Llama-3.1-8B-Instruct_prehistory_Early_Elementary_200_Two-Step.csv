A long, long time ago, before we could write things down, our ancestors lived. This time is called prehistory. It started about 200,000 years ago, when the first humans appeared. They changed a lot over time, becoming smarter and more like us. They made new tools and found ways to live together in groups. There were three big periods in prehistory: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During the Paleolithic time, people used stones to make tools and moved around a lot. In the Mesolithic time, people made better tools and started living in one place. In the Neolithic time, people grew their own food and had bigger groups. Archaeologists and scientists study prehistory to learn about our ancient family. They use clues to figure out how people lived a long time ago. This helps us understand how we became who we are today. [200 words]

A long, long time ago, humans didn't have writing or big cities. This was called prehistory. It started around 2.8 million years ago. Back then, humans were like apes, but they grew and changed into smart, talking humans. They made tools and learned to live together. There were three main times in prehistory: the old stone age, the middle stone age, and the new stone age. Each time, humans got better at making things and working together. We know about prehistory by finding old bones, tools, and other things that our ancestors left behind. Scientists study these things to learn more about the past. It's a fun and interesting way to learn about how humans lived a long time ago. We can learn a lot from what we find!

**Rewritten text:**

A long time ago, before people could write, there was a time called prehistory. It started when the first humans appeared and ended when people began to write. This time lasted about 5,000 years. During prehistory, people created tools, built homes, and developed their own cultures. 

There were three main periods: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic period saw the first humans and simple tools. The Mesolithic period saw more advanced tools and people moving to new places. The Neolithic period saw people start to farm and build big societies. 

We can learn about prehistory by looking at old things we've found and the stories people wrote long ago. Studying prehistory helps us understand how people lived a long time ago and how their societies developed. It's very important!
