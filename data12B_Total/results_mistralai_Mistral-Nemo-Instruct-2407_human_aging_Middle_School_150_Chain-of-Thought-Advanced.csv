Step 4: Follow your plan and write the final paragraph. Then calculate the grade level of the output.

Here's the plan:
1. Explain 'human aging' in a simple way, using words that are easy to understand.
2. Use short sentences and avoid complex vocabulary.
3. Use transitional phrases to connect ideas.
4. Use a simple sentence structure, such as subject-verb-object.

Now, let's write the paragraph and calculate the grade level:

Human aging is a natural process that happens over time. As we get older, our bodies change and don't work as well as they used to. This can make it harder to do daily tasks. Our skin gets wrinkles, our hair turns gray, and our bones can become fragile. Our organs, like our heart and lungs, may not work as efficiently. This is because our cells start to wear out and don't repair themselves as quickly. This process starts in our 20s and continues throughout our lives. It's a normal part of life, but it's important to take",5.1,77.43,7.0,8.3,6.09,8.27,3.73,4.9

Human aging is a natural process that happens to everyone over time. It's like a car that ages as it's driven more miles. Our bodies change in many ways. We might gain weight, lose muscle, or have less energy. Our skin may wrinkle, and our hair might turn gray or fall out. Our senses can weaken, too, like hearing or seeing things as well as we used to. Bones can become more fragile, making us more likely to break them. Our memory might not be as sharp, and we might take longer to do things. But remember, aging is a normal part of life, and many people enjoy their later years. Regular exercise, a healthy diet, and staying socially active can help us age more healthily and happily.",5.5,76.62,7.0,8.8,6.94,7.93,4.04,5.777777777777778

Final Paragraph:
Human aging is a natural process that happens over time. It's like when a flower grows and then wilts. Our bodies also change as we get older. Cells in our body start to stop working as well, and we may not heal as quickly as before. We might also have more health issues, like heart disease or diabetes. This is because our body's systems, like our heart and lungs, start to wear out. Aging is a part of life, but understanding it can help us live healthier lives.
