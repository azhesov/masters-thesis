**Final Output:**
Prehistory is the period before written history began. It spans from the start of human existence to around 3000 BCE. During this time, humans lived as hunter-gatherers, relying on nature for food and shelter. They created tools from stones and bones, and used simple languages without writing systems. Archaeologists study prehistory by examining artifacts and understanding how early humans adapted to different environments.

The time before written records are available is known as prehistory. It spans from the earliest humans to the invention of writing, around 3,400 years ago. Archaeologists and anthropologists study this period through artifacts and physical remains. They reconstruct societies, technologies, and cultures. Prehistory includes the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Each age marks significant advancements in tools and technology. This period is crucial for understanding human evolution and development.

The term 'prehistory' refers to the time before written records began. It spans from the emergence of the earliest humans to the creation of the first civilizations, roughly 3.3 million years ago until around 3200 BCE. This period is significant as it witnessed the evolution of our species, Homo sapiens, and the development of complex cultures. Archaeologists study this era through artifacts and physical remains, piecing together human history before it could be recorded in writing.
