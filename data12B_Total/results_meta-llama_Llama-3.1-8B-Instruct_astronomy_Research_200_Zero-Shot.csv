Astronomy is the study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. It involves the observation and analysis of stars, planets, galaxies, and other objects in the cosmos. Astronomers use a variety of techniques, including telescopes, spectrographs, and space-based observatories, to gather data and make observations about the universe.

Supernovae, the explosive deaths of massive stars, are a key area of study in astronomy. These events can release an enormous amount of energy, visible from millions of light-years away, and are thought to be responsible for the creation of heavy elements in the universe. Black holes, regions of spacetime where gravity is so strong that nothing, not even light, can escape, are another area of interest. Astronomers use observations of the motion of stars and gas near suspected black holes to confirm their existence.
