Step 4: Review your paragraph and make any necessary revisions.

**Step 1:** To explain 'human aging' at the college level, I'll focus on the biological processes rather than chronological time. I'll use terms like 'cellular senescence', 'telomeres', and 'genetic regulation'.

**Step 2:** Vocabulary: cellular senescence, telomeres, genetic regulation, chronological time, biological processes. Sentence structure: Use compound-complex sentences to convey complex ideas clearly.

**Step 3:** Human aging, often conflated with chronological time, is primarily a result of biological processes at the cellular level. This includes cellular senescence, a state where cells permanently stop dividing due to telomere shortening and genetic regulation changes, such as the activation of the p53 tumor suppressor gene.

**Step 4:** Review: The paragraph is clear, concise, and uses appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure. However, to improve",10.9,40.85,13.4,12.8,9.97,14.49,4.85,7.625

""Human aging is a multifaceted process characterized by progressive, functional decline across various physiological systems, ultimately leading to increased vulnerability to disease and death. This process is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as cellular senescence and telomere attrition, and extrinsic factors, like oxidative stress and inflammation, which accumulate over time due to the wear and tear of daily life.""",12.2,42.92,15.0,14.0,15.19,14.27,6.5,13.5

Human aging is an inevitable phenomenon that proceeds due to the intrinsic accumulation of damage at the molecular and cellular levels. Telomeres, protective caps on chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular senescence and functional decline. While we cannot halt aging, understanding its mechanisms may help postpone its onset and remediate its effects.",11.5,39.33,13.3,12.8,11.63,14.09,5.5,8.142857142857142

Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by progressive physiological decline, increased vulnerability to diseases, and elevated risk of death. It is driven by the cumulative effects of intrinsic factors, such as the molecular damage caused by reactive oxygen species (ROS), and extrinsic factors, like lifestyle choices and environmental toxins. The hallmarks of aging include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. Understanding the intricate interplay of these factors is crucial for developing targeted interventions to promote healthy aging and extend human lifespan.",15.0,19.37,17.0,14.9,16.64,17.34,7.08,8.142857142857142
