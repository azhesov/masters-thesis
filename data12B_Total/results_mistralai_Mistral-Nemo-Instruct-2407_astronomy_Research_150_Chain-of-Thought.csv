Astronomy, a branch of science dedicated to the study of celestial bodies and phenomena, is the perfect discipline for those captivated by the mysteries of the cosmos. At the research level, astronomers employ advanced mathematical models and sophisticated technologies, such as telescopes and satellites, to unravel the secrets of the universe. For instance, by analyzing the light emitted by distant galaxies, astronomers can determine their chemical composition and calculate their distances from Earth, enabling the construction of detailed cosmological maps. This interdisciplinary field not only advances our understanding of the cosmos but also contributes to technological advancements, making it a fascinating and dynamic area of study.",12.4,36.89,14.3,14.1,15.37,14.85,6.42,8.714285714285714
