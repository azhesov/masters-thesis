Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 50 words. Human aging refers to the biological, physiological, and psychological changes that occur in individuals as they age. These changes are influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. The process of aging can be divided into two main stages: senescence and death. Senescence is characterized by a decline in physical and mental abilities, while death marks the end of life. Aging is a natural process that affects all living organisms, but its rate and progression vary greatly among individuals and species. View More
What is the main cause of human aging?
The main cause of human aging is still a topic of debate and research. However, it is widely accepted that human aging is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. Some of the key factors that contribute to aging include:
* Telomere shortening: Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular aging.
* Epigenetic changes: Epigenetic changes refer to changes in gene","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Middle School and limit the output to 50 words:

* Telomere shortening: Telomeres are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes that shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular aging.
* Epigenetic changes: Epigenetic changes refer to changes in gene expression that occur as a result of environmental factors, leading to changes in cellular function and behavior.
* Oxidative stress: Oxidative stress occurs when the body's antioxidant defenses are overwhelmed by free radicals, leading to cellular damage and aging.
* Inflammation: Chronic inflammation can lead to cellular damage and aging.
* Lifestyle factors: Lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, and smoking can also contribute to aging.
These factors can interact with each other and with genetic factors to influence the rate and progression of aging. View More
What are the effects of human aging?
The effects of human aging can be seen in various aspects of life, including:
* Physical decline: As people age, they may experience a decline in physical abilities such as strength, flexibility, and coordination.

Human aging is a natural process that affects our bodies in many ways. As we age, our cells get older and less efficient. This can lead to problems like cancer, heart disease, and memory loss. Lifestyle choices, genetics, and the environment all play a role in how we age. Taking care of ourselves can help us stay healthy and feel our best as we get older.
