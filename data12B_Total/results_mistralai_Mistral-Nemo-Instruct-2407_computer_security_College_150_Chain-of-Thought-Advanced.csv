Prompt: ""Explain 'computer security' in 150 words""

Computer security, also known as information security, is the protection of computer systems, networks, and sensitive information from digital threats, damage, or unauthorized access. It involves implementing safeguards to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. These safeguards can include using strong passwords, installing security software, keeping systems up-to-date, and practicing safe online habits. Additionally, computer security involves detecting and responding to security breaches, such as malware infections or data leaks. Effective computer security requires a combination of technical measures and user awareness.",11.8,33.2,13.9,13.1,11.38,15.59,5.5,6.444444444444445
