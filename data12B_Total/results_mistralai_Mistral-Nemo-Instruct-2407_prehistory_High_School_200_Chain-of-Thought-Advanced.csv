Here's the result:

Prehistory, a term from the past, refers to the time before history began. It's like the unrecorded chapters of our planet's story. Before writing was invented, humans and our ancestors left behind tools, art, and structures. Archaeologists, scientists who study these remnants, help us understand our ancient past. This era, spanning from the Big Bang to the invention of writing, is fascinating and crucial for understanding our roots. It's a time of immense change, from the emergence of life to the dawn of civilization.

Prehistory is the period in history before written records. It stretches back to the dawn of human existence, about 3 million years ago. This era is divided into several time periods based on the tools and cultures of early humans. The Stone Age, for instance, is divided into Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. In the Paleolithic era, humans used simple stone tools and lived as hunter-gatherers. Over time, they developed new tools and settled in communities, marking the beginning of civilization.
