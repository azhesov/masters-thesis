Here's the plan in detail:

* Think about how to explain 'prehistory' in 50 words.
Prehistory is the time before written records. It began with the emergence of humans and ended with the invention of writing. This period is characterized by the development of tools, language, and complex societies.
* Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, so it will target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 17.
Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is calculated as: 0.39 × (total words / total sentences) + 11.8 × (total syllables / total words) - 15.59.

The final answer is: 
Prehistory is the period of human history before written records existed. It spans from the emergence of the first humans in Africa, approximately 300,000 years ago, to the invention of writing around 5,500 years ago. During this time, humans developed complex societies, tools, and technologies, laying the foundation for modern civilization. Archaeologists use artifacts, genetics, and other scientific methods to study and reconstruct prehistoric cultures. By examining these remnants, researchers can gain insights into the lives and experiences of our ancient ancestors. The study of prehistory allows us to understand how human societies evolved and how they responded to environmental and cultural changes.

The period before written records is known as prehistory. This time span includes the development of early humans and their cultures. The study of prehistory is based on archaeological evidence, such as artifacts and sites. It is a field that requires careful analysis and interpretation of the data. The results provide valuable insights into the lives of our ancient ancestors. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the origins of human societies and their evolution over time. The field of prehistory is a multidisciplinary study that draws on anthropology, archaeology, and history. It is a rich and complex field that continues to evolve as new discoveries are made.

Prehistory is a period of human history that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the development of written records. It encompasses the entire span of human existence before the invention of writing, which marks the beginning of recorded history. During prehistory, humans developed complex societies, created tools, and cultivated crops, but their achievements were not documented in written form.
