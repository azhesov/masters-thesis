Write a summary about 'nutrition'. Limit the output to 200 words. NUTRITION is the process of providing or obtaining the food necessary for health and growth. It involves the ingestion, absorption, and biological utilization of nutrients. Nutrients are substances that provide energy, promote growth, maintain life, and regulate body processes. There are six classes of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. Carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are macronutrients, needed in large amounts. Vitamins and minerals are micronutrients, required in small quantities. Water is essential for all body functions. Balanced nutrition is crucial for overall health, preventing chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and obesity. Poor nutrition can lead to malnutrition, stunting, wasting, and other health issues. Adequate nutrition is particularly important during growth periods, pregnancy, and lactation.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Graduate and limit the output to 200 words:

Nutrition, a crucial aspect of health, refers to the intake of food and beverages that provide essential nutrients to sustain life and promote growth, development, and overall well-being. It encompasses the process of consuming, absorbing, and utilizing these nutrients. Adequate nutrition is vital for maintaining optimal body functions, boosting immunity, and preventing chronic diseases like diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. A balanced diet, comprising macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals), is key to achieving nutritional balance. Regular physical activity, proper hydration, and a healthy weight are also integral parts of overall nutrition. Poor nutrition, conversely, can lead to malnutrition, obesity, and various health issues.
