""Do you know how to keep your computer safe? Computer security is like keeping your house safe. Just like you lock your front door to keep people from coming in, we lock our computers to keep bad guys from getting in. One way to do this is with a password. A password is a secret code that only you know. You type it in when you want to get into your computer or play a game. This keeps other people from getting in and doing bad things. You can also keep your computer safe by being careful when you click on things on the internet. Some websites might try to trick you into giving them your password or money. So, always ask a grown-up for help if you're not sure about something on the computer.""
