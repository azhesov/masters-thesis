## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the High School level.
To explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the High School level, we need to consider their background knowledge and the level of detail they can understand. We can start by defining prehistory as the period of time before written records existed, then provide examples of how people lived during that time.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
We should use vocabulary that is familiar to high school students, such as ""written records,"" ""cavemen,"" and ""tools."" The sentence structure should be clear and concise, with short sentences that build on each other.

Prehistory, the vast and mysterious period before written records existed, stretched from the emergence of the first humans around 200,000 years ago to the development of writing systems roughly 5,000 years ago. The lack of written accounts leaves us with a significant gap in understanding the intricacies of human life during this era, sparking endless curiosity and inquiry among historians and archaeologists.
Step 5: Use the paragraph to answer the question of how the lack of written records affects our understanding of the past.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the High School level.
To explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the High School level, I would start by defining it as the time period before written records existed. This would help them understand that it's a period of human history that doesn't involve written accounts. I would also mention that archaeologists and anthropologists study this period to learn about the lives of early humans.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
To make the explanation clear and engaging for High School readers, I would use simple and concise vocabulary. I would avoid using complex sentences or technical jargon that might be unfamiliar to them. For example, I would use the term ""early humans"" instead of ""prehistoric humans"" to make it more relatable.
