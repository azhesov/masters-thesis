The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
