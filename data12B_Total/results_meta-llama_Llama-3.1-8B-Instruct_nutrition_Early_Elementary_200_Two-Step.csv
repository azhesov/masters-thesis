Write a summary about 'nutrition'. Limit the output to 200 words. Nutrition is the process by which an organism, such as an animal or a plant, takes in and uses food to sustain life. It involves the consumption, absorption, and utilization of nutrients from food sources. Nutrients are essential for growth, maintenance, and repair of body tissues, as well as for energy production and other bodily functions. There are six main categories of nutrients: carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, minerals, and water. Carbohydrates provide energy, proteins build and repair tissues, fats store energy, vitamins and minerals regulate various bodily functions, and water maintains fluid balance. A balanced diet that includes a variety of nutrient-rich foods is essential for maintaining optimal health. Adequate nutrition is crucial for preventing and managing diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. It is also important for maintaining a healthy weight, promoting healthy growth and development, and supporting mental health.

We can use examples and analogies to help students understand complex concepts, such as what nutrients are and how they are found in different foods.

## Step 4: Focus on the basics
Since Early Elementary students are still learning the basics of nutrition, we should focus on the essential concepts and skip more advanced topics.
