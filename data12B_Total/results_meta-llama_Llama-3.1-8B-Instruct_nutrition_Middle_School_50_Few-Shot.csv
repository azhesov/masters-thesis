In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

The nutrient rich food is cooked on the stove, and a small piece falls on the floor. It begins to talk, saying, “Friends, from whence do you come here?” The food responds, “I was prepared to nourish my body but instead, I'm left to spoil. What a better fate would have been mine if consumed on time?” The floor says, “My fate is sealed, I remain unchanged.” The food and floor converse, speculating on their unfulfilled potential.​

As a fruit ripens on the tree, it absorbs more sugar and nutrients. If not picked, it falls on the ground and spoils. But, if eaten before spoilage, the fruit gives us energy and fiber. The nutrients also help our bodies grow strong and healthy. So, eating fresh fruits is good for us.   [Answer to be rewritten]

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on.

Example paragraph:
When a person eats food, the body begins to break it down into tiny parts called nutrients. The mouth chews the food into smaller pieces, the stomach mixes it with special juices, and the intestines absorb the nutrients. These nutrients give us energy to live, grow, and be healthy. They come from the food we eat, like fruits, vegetables, and grains. Just as the bean escaped the pan, we must escape hunger and find the right balance of nutrients to stay healthy. We must also take care to avoid too much of one type of food, or we might become unbalanced, like the straw that got too hot and burned. As the straw told the bean, a better fate falls to those who make healthy choices. By choosing the right foods, we can make our bodies strong and healthy, like the dry veneer that is cut to the right size and shape.

Nutrients in foods help our bodies grow. The carbohydrates in bread give us energy, like a coal that gets a second chance to burn. Proteins in meat help build muscles, and vitamins in fruits and vegetables keep us healthy. A balanced diet is like a crate, packed with the right foods to keep us strong.

‘Hey friends, let’s talk about nutrition! Food provides energy to our bodies. Eating a balanced diet means we get the right amounts of carbs, proteins, and fats. Without this, we could become weak and sick. Just like the bean, we need to ‘stay fresh’ and avoid being made into ‘broth’ without proper nourishment!’
‘But, would a better fate have fallen to our lot?’ asks the straw, questioning the importance of proper nutrition. ‘Yes, it would!’ replies the coal, ‘because nutrition keeps us burning bright and prevents us from being burnt out!’
