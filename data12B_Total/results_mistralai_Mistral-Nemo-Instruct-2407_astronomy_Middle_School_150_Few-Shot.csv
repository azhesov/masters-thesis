In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In the vast darkness of the night sky, a telescope is an astronomer's best friend. It helps them see things that are far away, much like how a magnifying glass makes words on a page appear bigger. To use a telescope, first, it must be pointed towards the sky. The telescope has a special tool called an 'equatorial mount' that helps it move smoothly in the right direction. Once pointed, the telescope collects light from the distant object, like a bucket gathering water from a stream. This light passes through lenses, which make the object appear bigger and clearer. Some telescopes even have cameras attached to capture images of these distant wonders. So, with a telescope, an astronomer can explore the night sky, discovering stars, planets, and galaxies that would otherwise be invisible to the naked eye.",8.0,75.34,10.4,8.8,9.86,7.83,4.86,11.0

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In the vast, dark sky, twinkling stars shine brightly, like distant candles. Astronomers, star lovers, study these stars using powerful telescopes. A telescope is like a giant magnifying glass, making stars and their groups, called constellations, appear closer. Constellations are like star pictures drawn in the night sky. For example, there's Orion, the Hunter, with his famous three-star belt. With a telescope, we can see stars' true colors, from red to blue, and even spot galaxies far away. It's like looking into the universe's great, mysterious book.",7.5,76.76,9.9,9.0,9.37,7.95,4.68,11.0

In the vast, dark universe, there is a tiny speck of light, a star. This star is not like others, it is our sun, and it warms our Earth. An astronomer, a scientist who studies the sky, looks through a telescope to see this star. He learns much about it, its age, its size, and its heat.
