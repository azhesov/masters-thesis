Computer security, or cybersecurity, is the protection of computers, networks, and data from harm. This includes keeping out bad software, like viruses and malware, and preventing unauthorized access to systems and networks. Computer security has three main goals: keeping information secret (confidentiality), making sure it's accurate and unchanged (integrity), and making sure it's available when needed (availability). To keep computers and data safe, a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls is used. This helps prevent and respond to security threats. Everyone, from individuals to governments, needs to take computer security seriously to stay safe online. Reply",14.8,19.87,16.0,15.6,11.36,16.35,5.15,12.833333333333334
