Here is the rewritten text in 150 words and at the level of Upper Elementary:

Computer security is like protecting a secret. You want to keep your computer and its information safe from people who shouldn't be able to see it. This is called cybersecurity. There are many bad things that can harm your computer, like viruses and malware. To keep your computer safe, you need to use strong passwords and update your software often. You also need to use a firewall, which is like a shield to block bad things from getting in. Additionally, you should be careful about what websites you visit and what links you click on. It's also important to keep your personal information private. By following these tips, you can help keep your computer and its information safe and secure. This is important because it helps keep your personal information safe and secure. It's like keeping a treasure safe from people who want to take it.
