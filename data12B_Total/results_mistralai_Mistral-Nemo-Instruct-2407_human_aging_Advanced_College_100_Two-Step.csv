Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process involving various biological changes at the cellular and molecular levels. Key processes include telomere shortening, epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and accumulation of damaged proteins. These changes lead to a decline in physiological functions, increasing the risk of age-related diseases and death. Interventions targeting these processes hold promise for promoting healthy aging and extending lifespan.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 100 words:
