Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 200 words. 'Prehistory' refers to the period before written history, encompassing the lives of early humans from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago until the invention of writing systems, around 3400 BCE. This era is divided into three main stages: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Stone Age is further divided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods, each marked by distinct advancements in tool-making and societal organization. The Paleolithic era, spanning from around 3.3 million years ago to 10,000 BCE, saw early humans as nomadic hunter-gatherers using simple stone tools. The Mesolithic period, from 10,000 to 8000 BCE, witnessed the transition to more settled lifestyles and the development of complex tools.

**Summary:**

Prehistory is the time before written records, spanning from 6 million years ago to around 3300 BCE. This era saw humans evolving from earlier ancestors, spreading worldwide, and building complex societies. It's split into Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages based on tool materials. Archaeology, using artifacts and fossils, helps us understand these ancient lives and environments. Learning about prehistory is key to understanding human history and our evolution.",11.9,38.42,14.5,13.9,11.77,15.43,5.24,11.833333333333334
