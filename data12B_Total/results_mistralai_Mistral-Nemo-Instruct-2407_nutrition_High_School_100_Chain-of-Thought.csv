Nutrition, simply put, is the process by which our bodies convert food into energy and other vital substances. It's like fuel for a car, but for us, it's not just about moving aroundâ€”it's about keeping our hearts beating, our brains thinking, and our bodies growing and repairing. Eating a balanced diet, filled with fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, ensures we get all the nutrients we need. Just like how a car runs best on high-quality gas, our bodies function best when we feed them nutritious foods.",7.4,71.65,10.6,9.8,9.93,10.15,5.05,7.2857142857142865

Nutrition refers to the process of providing your body with the food it needs to stay healthy. In other words, it's like fuel for your body. Just like a car needs gasoline to run, your body needs various nutrients to function properly. These nutrients include proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Each of these plays a unique role in keeping your body running smoothly. For example, proteins help build and repair tissues, while carbohydrates provide energy. Fats also provide energy and support cell growth. Vitamins and minerals, on the other hand, help your body perform many different functions, like boosting your immune system and aiding in digestion. To ensure you're getting all the nutrients you need, it's important to eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods.

Nutrition refers to the process of providing your body with the food it needs to function properly. Nutritious foods are those that offer essential nutrients like proteins, vitamins, and minerals. These nutrients support growth, repair damaged tissues, and maintain overall health. For example, fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins and minerals, while lean meats and beans provide necessary proteins. Balancing your meals with these nutritious foods ensures your body gets the energy and nutrients it requires to thrive.",8.6,57.67,11.2,12.1,11.01,12.81,4.87,7.375
