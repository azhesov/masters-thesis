Step 1: Think about how to explain 'computer security' in 50 words.
Computer security is a way to protect computers and information from being damaged or stolen. Hackers try to break into systems to steal personal info. Security measures like firewalls and passwords help keep info safe.

Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, so it will target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 8.
The revised paragraph should have the following characteristics: 
* Use shorter sentences (1-2 sentences per thought).
* Choose simpler vocabulary (e.g., ""hackers"" instead of ""cyber-attackers"").
* Avoid complex sentence structures (e.g., no subordinate clauses).
