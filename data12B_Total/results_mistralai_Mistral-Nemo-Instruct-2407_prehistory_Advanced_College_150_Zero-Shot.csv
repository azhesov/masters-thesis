Prehistory, the dawn of human existence before written records, is an enigmatic era. It spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa around 300,000 years ago to the advent of written languages, approximately 3,200 BCE in Mesopotamia. This period, devoid of contemporary documentation, is reconstructed through archaeological artifacts, fossil records, and oral traditions. Key advancements include the development of stone tools (Paleolithic), the control of fire, and the establishment of early human societies. Prehistory ends with the Neolithic Revolution, marking the transition from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled agricultural communities, and the subsequent birth of civilizations.",13.2,29.55,16.4,14.8,16.34,17.69,6.61,10.571428571428571

Prehistory, a term coined by the French historian Jules Michelet in the 19th century, refers to the period before written records, spanning from the emergence of the earliest hominids to the invention of writing. This era is subdivided into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, each characterized by the primary material used for tool creation. Archaeological evidence suggests that during this time, human societies transitioned from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to more sedentary agricultural communities. The study of prehistory, known as prehistory or paleoanthropology, employs archaeological, geological, and biological methods to reconstruct human evolution and cultural development during this formative period.",15.7,17.54,17.5,16.5,17.67,17.52,6.82,12.166666666666666

The term 'prehistory' refers to the time period before written records were kept, often associated with the Stone Age. This era spans from the emergence of the first humans around 2.6 million years ago to the invention of writing, which varies by culture but generally falls between 3400-3200 BCE. Prehistory is thus a vast epoch, divided into several periods based on technological advancements and cultural developments. Key stages include the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age), each characterized by distinct tool-making techniques, hunting practices, and societal structures. The study of prehistory is primarily archaeological, with scholars analyzing artifacts, fossils, and environmental data to reconstruct human lives and cultures in the absence of written sources. This period witnessed significant migrations, innovations like agriculture, and the establishment of early civilizations, setting the stage for historical periods.",13.7,28.23,16.0,14.9,15.14,16.35,6.2,8.857142857142858
