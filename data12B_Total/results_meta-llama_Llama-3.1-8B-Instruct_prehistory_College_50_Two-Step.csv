It spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the development of writing, approximately 5 million years ago to 3000 BCE. This era saw the rise of early human societies, cultures, and civilizations. Key events and achievements include the discovery of tools, fire, agriculture, and the development of complex societies. Prehistory is often divided into three periods: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). This era laid the foundation for modern human societies and cultures. Key figures, such as early Homo sapiens and Neanderthals, also played a significant role in shaping human history.

The prehistory of humans is a time period that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing, which varies by region but is generally considered to be around 5,000 years ago. The time period is divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic period, also known as the Old Stone Age, spanned from 2.5 million years ago to 10,000 years ago. During this period, early humans developed tools and learned to control fire. The Mesolithic period, also known as the Middle Stone Age, spanned from 10,000 years ago to 5,000 years ago. During this period, humans developed more sophisticated tools and began to settle in permanent locations. The Neolithic period, also known as the New Stone Age, spanned from 5,000 years ago to 2,000 years ago. During this period, humans developed agriculture and began to domesticate animals. The prehistory of humans is a complex and fascinating time period that has been studied by archaeologists and historians for centuries.
