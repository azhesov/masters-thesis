In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

When a hacker tries to breach the system, their actions are detected by the monitoring software. The software sends a message to the security team who then block the hacker’s access. The system has a backup of all the data, which can be easily restored in case of a breach. The backup is stored in a separate location to prevent damage from a single point of failure. The security team reviews the system regularly to prevent any future breaches. The system also has a firewalls to prevent unauthorized access. The system is designed to protect the data at all costs.

Example paragraph:
The fire wall began and said, “Dear friends, from whence do you come here?” The computer replied, “I fortunately have a firewall, and if I hadn’t been protected, my data would have been stolen, and I should have been hacked to pieces.” The vulnerable data said, “I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the hacker had got me, I should have been compromised without any mercy, like my comrades.” “And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?” said the firewall.

The analogy is between the bean (vulnerable data) and the coal (firewall) in terms of their respective fates without protection. The bean would be ""made into broth"" (hacked), while the coal would be ""burnt to ashes"" (hacked into pieces) without",8.3,74.53,10.5,9.7,10.48,7.37,4.83,11.0

To prevent hackers from getting into their computers, people use firewalls. The firewall acts like a bouncer at a nightclub, keeping out unwanted visitors. If a hacker tries to access a computer, the firewall will block them. Like a straw that escapes the fire, a firewall helps keep our data safe from being destroyed. A computer can also be like the bean that escaped the cooking pot. By using strong passwords and being cautious, we can prevent our computers from being hacked. Thus, a firewall and our own security habits can keep our computers secure. 

This response is written in a style that is similar to the two examples. The vocabulary and sentence structure are at a level that would be accessible to a middle school student.

The security system protects the computer from viruses and hacking. It is like a strong wall that keeps the bad guys out. A firewall is like a gatekeeper that checks who wants to come in and out of the computer. The antivirus software is like a guard that scans the computer for any signs of intruders. If it finds a virus, it removes it before it can cause any damage. The security system is also like a sentry that constantly watches for any suspicious activity. It keeps the computer safe from harm and ensures that all data is secure. This is crucial for online safety.  (99 words)

Here is a malicious program that has infected the computer system. It was first spotted by a keen-eyed programmer who noticed a suspicious piece of code. The program, if not contained, could have caused serious damage, and potentially even deleted all the data. Fortunately, the programmer was able to isolate the program and prevent it from spreading. ‘If I hadn’t been paying close attention, I would have been caught off guard’, said the programmer. ‘And my computer would have been hacked without any mercy, like the rest of the system’, said another programmer in agreement. ‘And would a better fate have fallen to our system?’ said the first programmer.

The internet is like a big forest, full of dangers. A 'cracker' is like a sneaky fox who tries to steal your valuable things. They might try to 'hack' into your computer and 'exploit' its weaknesses. But don't worry, there are ways to protect yourself. An 'antivirus' program is like a clever rabbit who can sniff out the sneaky fox and chase it away. A 'firewall' is like a strong fence that keeps the fox out in the first place. And always remember to keep your 'password' safe and secret.

These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 100 words. The software of a computer contains many tools that need protection. Just like the bean was about to be cooked, a computer program can be attacked by malicious code, also called a virus. A virus can cause harm to the computer and steal personal information. The straw, which could have been burnt to ashes, represents a firewall that protects the computer from the virus. Just like the straw, the firewall keeps the malicious code from entering the computer and causing damage. This protection is called computer security. It helps keep the computer safe from harm. Example vocabulary: malicious, steal, protection, harmless. Example structure: 'Just like...' comparisons.

Here is a short paragraph about computer security:
In a computer, there are many pieces of information, like digital pictures, which are stored. But if the computer's 'door' was left open, someone could easily take a picture or use it for something else. A 'firewall' is like a strong wall that protects the computer's 'door' from harm. It keeps the bad 'coal' (a bad person trying to get in) from entering and stops the computer from being used for something it wasn't made for. A 'password' is like a secret key that only the owner knows to keep their information safe. This is computer security. 
Note: The word count of the paragraph is 99.  The vocabulary is suitable for middle school students, with examples from the original examples.  The structure is similar to the original examples, with three subjects (digital pictures, firewall, and password) and a narrative style.  The paragraph uses the metaphors of 'door",7.8,75.95,10.1,10.1,9.97,7.72,4.72,11.0

Example paragraph:
Imagine you have a big box of cookies. You want to keep them safe from prying eyes, so you lock the box with a key. This is like computer security. The box is the computer, and the key is a password or code that keeps hackers out. But what if a sneaky person figures out the key or finds a way to pick the lock? They could steal your cookies or even damage the box. To stay safe, you should use strong passwords, keep your software up to date, and be careful about clicking on links or opening emails from unknown sources.
