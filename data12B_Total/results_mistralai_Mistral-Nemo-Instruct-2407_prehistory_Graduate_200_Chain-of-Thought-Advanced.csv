""Prehistory is the period before written records were kept. It began with the first humans and ended when people started writing things down. This time span is incredibly long, stretching back over 3 million years. During prehistory, people lived in small groups called tribes. They hunted and gathered food, and made tools from stones and bones. Life was tough, and people had to work together to survive. As time passed, they began to create art and build shelters. Eventually, they started farming and raising animals, which changed their lives forever. However, we don't know much about this time because there are no books or records to tell us what happened. Instead, we rely on clues left behind by ancient people, like tools and paintings, to learn about their lives.""

**Prehistory** is the period of time before written records were kept by humans. It spans from the emergence of the first hominids around 6 million years ago to the invention of writing systems, which occurred independently in various civilizations around the globe, roughly 3,400 to 5,000 years ago. During this extensive era, humanity transitioned from a primate-like existence to the development of complex societies. Prehistoric people left behind physical artifacts, such as tools, weapons, and art, which archaeologists use to study their cultures and behaviors. These artifacts, along with fossil evidence, help paint a picture of human evolution and the ways early humans adapted to their environments. Prehistory is often divided into distinct periods based on technological advances, with the most well-known being the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.",10.2,48.2,12.0,12.2,11.72,12.75,5.17,5.1
