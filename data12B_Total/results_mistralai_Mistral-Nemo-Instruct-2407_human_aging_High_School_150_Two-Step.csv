Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. The summary should include a definition of 'human aging', causes, signs, and potential treatments.

Human aging is the progressive accumulation of changes in a person over time, leading to increased vulnerability and risk of disease. It is caused by a combination of intrinsic factors (genetic and cellular changes) and extrinsic factors (environmental and lifestyle influences). Signs include physical changes (wrinkles, gray hair, reduced vision), cognitive changes (slower learning, memory loss), and increased risk of chronic diseases. Potential treatments include caloric restriction, exercise, and medications targeting specific pathways involved in aging, such as senolytics and mTOR inhibitors. However, a cure for aging remains elusive, and the best approach is currently prevention through healthy habits and management of age-related diseases.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 150 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. 'Human aging' refers to the progressive accumulation of changes in an organism over time, leading to a decrease in physiological function and an increased risk of disease and death. This process is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetics and cellular damage, and extrinsic factors like environmental stress and lifestyle choices. Theories of aging include the oxidative stress theory, which suggests that damage from reactive oxygen species contributes to aging, and the telomere theory, which posits that shortening telomeres in our cells leads to cellular senescence and organismal aging. Interventions aimed at slowing or reversing aging, such as caloric restriction and senolytics, are areas of active research.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 150 words:

Rewritten text:

Aging is a complicated process where our bodies change over time. This includes becoming more prone to diseases and eventually dying. It's influenced by our genes, random events, and our environment. Key changes involve parts of our DNA getting shorter, our cells' ability to communicate changing, and our cells becoming old and worn out. There are different ideas about why we age, like the idea that our cells wear out over time, or that damage from molecules called free radicals causes aging. Some studies suggest that limiting food intake, exercising, and certain medicines might help us live longer, healthier lives. But we still don't fully understand aging or how to reverse it, so more research is needed.",12.5,36.79,15.4,14.7,15.09,15.83,6.26,13.833333333333334

Human aging is a complex, progressive process characterized by a gradual decline in physiological function and an increased risk of disease. It is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Aging is marked by changes in various systems of the body, including the cardiovascular, immune, and nervous systems. The process is often associated with a decline in physical strength, cognition, and overall health. It is also a major risk factor for many diseases, such as cancer, heart disease, and Alzheimer's disease. While the exact mechanisms of aging are not fully understood, research suggests that cellular damage and the accumulation of molecular changes over time play a significant role. Interventions aimed at slowing or reversing aging, such as caloric restriction and exercise, have shown promise in animal studies, but their effects on human longevity are not yet clear.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 150 words:

High School Level: Aging is when our body changes over time. It happens slowly and includes many parts of our body. We might get weaker or have trouble remembering things. Aging makes us more likely to get sick, like cancer or heart problems. Scientists aren't sure exactly why we age, but they think it's because cells get damaged over time. Exercising and eating right might help us live longer, but more research is needed. Knowing how we age can help us stay healthy as we get older.",9.6,54.93,11.1,11.4,11.29,11.54,5.34,8.571428571428571
