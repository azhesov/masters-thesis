The term ""nutrition"" encompasses the consumption, metabolism, and utilization of nutrients by the body. This includes macronutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, as well as micronutrients like vitamins and minerals. Nutrients are essential for maintaining optimal bodily functions, including growth, development, and the prevention of diseases. Adequate nutrition is crucial for physical health, mental health, and overall well-being. The body requires a balanced intake of nutrients to function correctly, and deficiencies in certain nutrients can lead to various health problems. Nutrition also plays a significant role in maintaining a healthy weight, improving mental performance, and supporting the immune system. Furthermore, nutrition is linked to chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and certain types of cancer. Therefore, a well-balanced diet that incorporates a variety of nutrient-dense foods is essential for maintaining optimal nutrition and overall health.

Nutrition is the intake of nutrients required by an organism or a biological system for growth, maintenance, reproduction, and response to a stimulus. The nutrients are the substances, such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals, that the organism requires in order to maintain its health. The main sources of nutrients for humans are food, water, and sunlight. The nutritional value of food is determined by the amounts of the various nutrients it contains, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and the amount of energy it provides. The nutritional needs of humans vary depending on their age, sex, and physical activity level. The World Health Organization (WHO) has established guidelines for the recommended intake of essential nutrients. Maintaining a healthy diet is important for preventing chronic diseases, such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. A well-planned diet can provide the necessary nutrients to maintain optimal health.
