Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by progressive functional decline, increased susceptibility to disease, and ultimately, death. This gradual deterioration can be attributed to cumulative damage from various sources, including oxidative stress, telomere attrition, and epigenetic alterations. Additionally, aging is influenced by genetic factors, lifestyle choices, and environmental exposures.",13.7,22.92,15.7,14.6,16.83,17.51,6.74,11.25

Human aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by progressive functional decline across multiple organ systems, leading to increased susceptibility to disease and eventual death. This intricate biological phenomenon is governed by intricate molecular and cellular mechanisms, including telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, and accumulation of cellular damage, which are interconnected and contribute synergistically to the overall aging process.",14.9,19.67,16.3,15.2,16.51,16.82,6.82,12.666666666666666

Human aging, at the cellular level, is characterized by a decline in the functionality of cells and tissues due to the accumulation of damage over time. This process is governed by various molecular mechanisms, including telomere shortening, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, and mitochondrial dysfunction, which collectively contribute to the increased vulnerability and decreased regenerative capacity of aged organisms.",14.5,26.2,15.8,15.6,17.64,15.43,6.94,14.6
