In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

A nutritionist helps people understand what their bodies need to be healthy. They learn about vitamins and minerals. These are like the beans in the story, crucial for our growth and energy. Too little or too much can be bad, like the straw that burns too fast or the beans that might get too old. A nutritionist helps balance this. They advise on how much to eat, what to eat, and when to eat. Just like the careful process of drying veneer, they guide us to keep our bodies in good shape.",7.7,76.05,9.2,8.7,9.58,6.91,4.57,11.0

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 150 words. ""Nutrition"" is the process of providing or obtaining the food necessary for health and growth. It involves the intake and use of nutrients, which are the components in food that provide energy and support body functions.

In our bodies, nutrition begins when we eat a meal. Food enters our mouth, where it's broken down by teeth and mixed with saliva. This mixture, called a bolus, is swallowed and travels down the esophagus to the stomach. Here, stomach acid and enzymes further break down the food into a semi-liquid mixture called chyme. Nutrients from the chyme are then absorbed into the bloodstream through the small intestine, fueling our bodies and supporting growth and health. The remaining waste is eliminated as feces. Just like the beans in the story, our bodies carefully process and utilize the nutrients from our food to maintain life.",7.9,75.74,10.2,9.7,10.32,7.95,4.98,11.0

- A comparison of the foods' 'vital' and 'energy' properties
- A reference to a part of the body

Vegetables and nuts are both vital for our bodies. They provide energy, just like the coal gave heat to the fire. However, nuts are like the straw, they give a big burst of energy, but vegetables are more like the coal, they burn steadily and keep us going all day.

Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.'
