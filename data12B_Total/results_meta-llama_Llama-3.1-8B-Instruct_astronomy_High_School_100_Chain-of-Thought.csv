Here's my attempt at writing a paragraph about astronomy at the High School level:

Astronomy is the study of the universe, including the sun, moon, stars, planets, and galaxies. It is a branch of science that helps us understand how the universe was formed, how it has changed over time, and how it is still changing today. Astronomers use a variety of techniques, including telescopes, space probes, and computer simulations, to gather information about the universe. By studying the universe, astronomers can learn about the laws of physics that govern the behavior of objects in space, and how these laws have been influenced by the universe's history. Through their research, astronomers can gain a deeper understanding of the universe and its many mysteries.
