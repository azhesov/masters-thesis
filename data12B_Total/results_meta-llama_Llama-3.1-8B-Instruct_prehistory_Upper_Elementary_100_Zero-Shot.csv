Prehistory is a long, long time ago, before people wrote down their stories and histories. During prehistory, humans lived on Earth and created tools, hunted animals, and grew food. They also made art, like paintings and carvings, and built homes. People moved around, searching for food and shelter. Some groups of humans were nomadic, traveling from place to place, while others settled in one spot and built more permanent homes. We know about prehistory by studying the things they left behind, like fossils, tools, and artifacts. These clues help us learn about the lives of people who lived before written history.

Prehistory is a time period that comes before recorded history. It is the time when humans first appeared on Earth and before people wrote down events. During this time, humans lived in small groups and relied on hunting and gathering for food. They made tools from stones and bones and built homes from natural materials like branches and leaves. People also began to develop skills like making fire and creating art. We don't know exactly how people lived during prehistory because we don't have any written records, but we can learn about it by studying artifacts and fossils.   - ## Categories

Long ago, people did not write down their stories or histories. That's why this time in human history is called prehistory. People made tools and hunted animals for food. They also gathered fruits and vegetables to eat. Some people lived in caves and others built shelters made of sticks and mud. They didn't have cars or phones, so they had to walk or run to get around. People also started to farm the land, growing their own food and raising animals for meat. This was a big change from just hunting and gathering. It helped people settle in one place.  #Prehistory #UpperElementary #ReadabilityLevel #ShortParagraph #100Words

The prehistoric period was a time long, long ago when humans first appeared on Earth. It started about 2.5 million years ago and lasted until the invention of writing around 5,000 years ago. During this time, early humans like Neanderthals and Homo sapiens roamed the Earth, searching for food and shelter. They made tools and hunted animals to survive. They also developed early forms of art and language. These early humans lived in small groups and migrated to different parts of the world. This period is often divided into different stages, such as the Stone Age and the Bronze Age. The prehistoric period is a fascinating time in human history. It's a time of discovery and exploration, and it lays the foundation for the civilizations that came after. It's a time when humans learned to adapt to their environments and develop new technologies to survive. It's also a time of great cultural and artistic expression.

Prehistory is the time before we had written records. It started millions of years ago and lasted until around 5,000 years ago. During this time, humans and other animals lived and evolved. People made tools and hunted for food. They also started to grow their own food and build homes. As time went on, people started to live in groups and make art. They also began to write symbols on rocks and walls. These symbols helped them keep track of important things like the seasons and the location of food. This is how we know about the lives of people from prehistory.

Prehistory is the time before written records existed. It spans from the emergence of the first humans about 300,000 years ago to the development of writing systems around 5,000 years ago. During this period, humans lived in small groups, hunting and gathering food. They made tools from stones, bones, and wood. As time passed, people began to farm and settle in one place. This marked the start of civilization. The study of prehistory helps us understand how our ancestors lived and how human societies evolved over time. Archaeologists use clues like fossils, artifacts, and rock art to learn about prehistory.

Prehistory refers to the time before written records existed. It's a period that started millions of years ago, during the time of dinosaurs, and ended around 5,000 years ago, when people began writing down their stories and events. During prehistory, humans and other animals lived in caves, forests, and deserts. People hunted for food, gathered fruits and berries, and made their own tools from rocks and sticks. They also developed basic shelters, such as tents and huts. Archaeologists study the remains of these early humans to learn about their lives and cultures. Their discoveries help us understand how people lived before written records began.
