Write a summary about 'astronomy'. Limit the output to 100 words. Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It involves physics, mathematics, and chemistry, and aims to understand the origins and evolution of objects in the universe. Astronomers observe celestial bodies like stars, galaxies, and planets, as well as events like supernovae and eclipses. They use ground-based and space-based telescopes, along with theoretical models and computer simulations, to make discoveries about the universe's structure, composition, and history.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of College and limit the output to 100 words:
