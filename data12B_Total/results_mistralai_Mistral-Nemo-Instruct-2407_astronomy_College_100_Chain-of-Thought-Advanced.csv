Final Paragraph:
Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It involves the use of telescopes and other instruments to observe the universe and understand its components, such as stars, planets, and galaxies. Additionally, astronomers study the physical properties of celestial bodies and the laws that govern their motion.

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It uses physics, mathematics, and chemistry to explain the universe's structure and behavior. Astronomy explores stars, planets, galaxies, and other celestial bodies, seeking to understand their origin, evolution, and interactions. It also investigates the universe's large-scale structures and its fundamental physical properties. Through observation and theory, astronomy helps us understand our place in the cosmos and the laws that govern it.
