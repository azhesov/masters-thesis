Prehistory is the period of time before recorded history, which began with the emergence of the first humans and continued until the development of written records, typically around 5,000 years ago. This era is characterized by the development of human societies, the rise of complex cultures, and the creation of tools and technologies that enabled humans to adapt to their environments.
Prehistory is often divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic period, which spanned from approximately 2.5 million to 10,000 years ago, saw the emergence of early humans, the development of basic tools, and the beginning of hunting and gathering. The Mesolithic period, which occurred from around 10,000 to 5,000 years ago, saw the development of more complex societies and the use of more sophisticated tools. The Neolithic period, which began around 5,000 years ago, marked the transition to agriculture and the rise of settled communities.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Graduate and limit the output to 200 words:

Prehistory refers to the vast expanse of human history preceding the advent of writing. This epoch encompasses the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods, which together span approximately 2.6 million years. The Paleolithic era, marked by the emergence of early human societies, witnessed the development of rudimentary tools and the exploitation of food sources through hunting and gathering. The subsequent Mesolithic period saw the rise of more complex societies, accompanied by the deployment of more sophisticated tools and the inception of agriculture. The Neolithic era, characterized by the establishment of settled agriculture, animal domestication, and the emergence of complex societies, marked a significant turning point in human societal development. This epoch laid the groundwork for the evolution of modern human societies, marked by transformative changes and advancements. (200 words)
