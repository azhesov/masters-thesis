""Human aging"" refers to the progressive accumulation of changes in an individual over time, leading to a decline in physical, psychological, and social functioning. It is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Aging is characterized by various biological processes, such as telomere shortening, epigenetic changes, and altered cell signaling. This results in increased vulnerability to chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Age-related changes also affect the skin, muscles, bones, and other organs, contributing to frailty and disability. Cognitive abilities may decline, impacting memory, learning, and decision-making. Socially, aging individuals often experience changes in their roles and relationships, which can influence mental health and well-being. Interventions targeting these processes, such as exercise, healthy diet, and cognitive stimulation, can help maintain health and quality of life in older age.

**Revised Text:**

Human aging is a multifaceted process marked by declining physiological functions, increased disease vulnerability, and heightened mortality risk. Both inherent factors like genetics and cellular changes, and external factors such as environment and lifestyle, contribute to this process. Intrinsic factors include telomere shortening, caused by DNA replication's ""end replication problem,"" and cumulative cellular damage over time. External factors encompass environmental toxins, poor nutrition, inactivity, and psychological stress. Ongoing research aims to decipher aging's mechanisms and develop interventions to slow, halt, or reverse it. Promising avenues include targeting specific molecular pathways, like those involving sirtuins or mTOR, and exploring senolytics, which selectively eliminate senescent cells. Further human studies are needed to assess these interventions' safety and effectiveness.",14.1,27.22,17.5,16.2,14.29,17.93,5.89,14.2

1. **Cellular Changes**: Telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, eventually leading to cellular senescence or death.
2. **Organ System Degeneration**: Aging affects all organ systems, with the cardiovascular system, nervous system, and musculoskeletal system often showing significant changes.
3. **Increased Disease Risk**: Older adults are at higher risk for chronic diseases like heart disease, cancer, diabetes, and Alzheimer's.
4. **Decreased Physical Function**: Aging often brings reduced strength, flexibility, and coordination, impacting mobility and daily activities.
