Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Human aging is a complex process characterized by the accumulation of cellular and molecular changes that affect an individual's physical, cognitive, and functional abilities. As people age, their cells undergo various forms of damage, including DNA mutations, epigenetic changes, and telomere shortening. These changes can lead to the activation of senescence, a state in which cells cease to divide and can contribute to tissue dysfunction. Additionally, the aging process is influenced by various factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental exposures. Senescent cells can contribute to the development of age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the mechanisms underlying human aging is essential for the development of effective interventions to promote healthy aging and prevent age-related diseases. Researchers are actively exploring potential strategies to target senescent cells and mitigate the effects of aging.
