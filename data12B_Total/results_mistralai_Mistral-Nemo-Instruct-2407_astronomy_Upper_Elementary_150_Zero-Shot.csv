Astronomy is the study of space, including stars, planets, and galaxies. It's like exploring the universe's giant puzzle! Astronomers use powerful telescopes to observe far-off objects. This helps us understand our place in the universe and how things work up there. For example, we've learned that our sun is a star, just like many others. Isn't that cool? But here's a fun fact: Did you know that a day on Venus is longer than a year on Venus? That's because Venus takes about 243 Earth days to rotate once on its axis, but it only takes around 225 Earth days for Venus to orbit the sun!
