Revised Text:
Long ago, before people wrote stories, there was 'prehistory'. It starts with the big bang, when the universe was born. Then, stars, planets, and life began to form. In prehistory, tiny life forms appeared and grew bigger. This includes the start of humans' early ancestors. Prehistory ends about 11,700 years ago, when the last big ice age ended. This is when people started farming and writing, which means history began.",9.4,55.64,11.9,12.4,10.99,12.12,4.77,14.8

**Elementary Version:**

Prehistory is the time before people wrote things down. It starts when the first people came and ends when they started writing. This time has three big parts: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Stone Age is split into three smaller parts: Old Stone Age, Middle Stone Age, and New Stone Age. During this time, people made tools, drew pictures, and lived together in groups. The end of prehistory is when people started writing and keeping records. This time is important because it shows how people changed and learned new things.",8.0,64.61,10.5,11.3,9.4,10.95,4.37,11.333333333333334

In simple terms, prehistory is like the time before books. It's when early humans lived, used stones for tools, and learned to farm. People moved around a lot and made important changes like building houses and learning to use metals. We learn about this time by finding old things, like tools and buildings, and studying them. This time period ended when people started writing things down.",10.9,46.37,12.7,13.4,12.45,13.22,5.34,15.2

Prehistory is the time before people could write. It starts when humans, like us, first appeared. That was about 300,000 years ago. It ends when people in different places started writing, around 3400 to 3200 BCE. We call this time the Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, based on the tools people used.
