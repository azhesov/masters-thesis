Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities.

Computer security is the scholarly and scientific study of protecting information from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It is the study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics of cyber threats, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities. 
Computer security is studied by experts, such as network security specialists, cryptographers, and system administrators, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians and philosophers of information. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in computer security may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested. 
As a result, it is crucial to implement the most up-to-date security measures and best practices to prevent cyber threats, protect sensitive information and maintain the integrity of systems and networks. It is also essential to continuously monitor and evaluate security measures to ensure that they are effective and up-to-date. By doing so, organizations can minimize the risk of cyber attacks and maintain",15.5,34.39,18.8,17.3,17.1,14.1,6.98,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

The burgeoning field of computer security is an interdisciplinary study of methods and tools used to protect information, systems, and networks from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, inspection, recording or destruction. Its application spans various domains, including cybersecurity, cryptography, and risk management. This multidisciplinary field is critical for modern societies.  


The term ""computer security"" was first used in the 1960s in the context of mainframe computers, and has since evolved to encompass various aspects of digital security, including network security, data security, and application security. The study of computer security is crucial for protecting sensitive information and preventing cyber threats. It involves the use of encryption, firewalls, and other technologies to safeguard digital assets and prevent unauthorized access. The field of computer security is interdisciplinary, drawing on concepts from computer science, mathematics, and social sciences. It requires a comprehensive understanding of the vulnerabilities of computer systems and networks, as well as the development of effective countermeasures",16.0,27.56,18.6,17.4,17.49,14.97,7.11,18.0

Computer security is the protection of information technology (IT) from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This protection involves physical, technical, and administrative controls. It's a vital discipline as data breaches and cyber-attacks have become increasingly common and costly. Its study involves cryptography, access control and intrusion detection.  ​

The study of computer security (from the Greek komputos, ""reckoning"" and ergasia, ""work"" and phylake, ""guarding""), is the scholarly and scientific study of safeguarding and protecting information and computer systems from malicious threats. It is a multidisciplinary field that relies on computer science, mathematics, and engineering principles.  The field is concerned with the security of networks, software, hardware, and data.  It also involves the study of cryptography, access control, and incident response.  Its purpose is to protect against unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction of information and systems.  Physical and logical security are also considered in computer security.  Computer security is a complex field that requires a multidisciplinary approach to protect against a variety of threats, including hacking, malware, and other forms of cyber attacks.
