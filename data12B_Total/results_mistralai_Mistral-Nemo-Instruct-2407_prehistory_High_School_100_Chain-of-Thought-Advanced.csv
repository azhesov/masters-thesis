**Final Paragraph:**

""Prehistory is the period before written history. It started with humans' first appearance around 2 million years ago and ended roughly 5,000 years ago. During this time, humans lived as hunter-gatherers, migrating and adapting to changing environments. They developed tools, language, and culture, but no written records. Archaeologists and anthropologists study this era through artifacts, fossils, and cultural remains.""

The term 'prehistory' refers to the time period before written records were created. It spans from the beginning of human existence until the invention of writing, which happened independently in various civilizations around 3500 BCE. During this time, humans lived as hunter-gatherers, relying on nature for survival. They developed tools, language, and social structures, but their stories and knowledge were passed down orally. Archaeologists study prehistory by examining artifacts, such as stone tools, pottery, and architecture, to understand how our ancestors lived and evolved.",9.3,50.33,11.3,11.4,10.4,12.63,4.82,5.777777777777778

To calculate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of this text, we count the total words, total sentences, and total syllables.

- Total words: 52
- Total sentences: 5
- Total syllables: 87 (using a syllable counter tool)

Now, plug these numbers into the formula:

0.39 × (52 / 5) + 11.8 × (87 / 52) - 15.59 ≈ 10.9
