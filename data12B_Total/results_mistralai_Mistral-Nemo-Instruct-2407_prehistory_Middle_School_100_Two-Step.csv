Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 100 words. Prehistory refers to the time before written records. It spans from the emergence of the first humans around 6 million years ago until the invention of writing, around 3,400 BCE. This vast period is divided into epochs based on tool usage, climate, and human evolution. Key stages include the Stone Age (Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic), Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Prehistoric humans migrated globally, developing cultures, technologies, and societies. Archaeology and anthropology are primary sources for understanding this era.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Middle School and limit the output to 100 words:

Despite the lack of written records, we learn about prehistory through archaeology, studying ancient artifacts, and anthropology, understanding early human cultures.

Prehistory is the time before writing. It starts when early humans, Homo habilis, appeared, around 2.1 million years ago. It ends when people first started writing, about 5,000 years ago. There are three big time periods: Stone Age (early, middle, late), Bronze Age, and Iron Age. People in these times made tools, moved around, and started farming. We learn about this time by studying old things (archaeology) and understanding early human ways (anthropology).",9.8,49.21,11.8,11.2,9.65,13.04,4.52,8.714285714285714
