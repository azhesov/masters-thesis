In the early 2000s, computer security emerged as a critical concern as the internet became ubiquitous. Traditional security measures, such as firewalls and antivirus software, were insufficient against evolving threats. Researchers and practitioners alike recognized the need for a more holistic approach, leading to the development of disciplines like information assurance and cybersecurity. These fields emphasize proactive measures, such as risk assessment and secure software development, alongside reactive ones, like incident response and forensics. They also integrate ethical and legal considerations, reflecting the complex, multifaceted nature of computer security.",12.7,30.87,14.5,13.7,14.0,16.17,6.08,8.857142857142858

*Writing:*

Computer security, at the advanced level, encompasses a spectrum of strategies aimed at safeguarding computers and networks from malicious activities, harm, or unauthorized access. These strategies can be grouped into three primary categories: physical security, logical security, and administrative security. Physical security entails protecting hardware components and infrastructure from physical threats, such as theft or damage. Logical security, on the other hand, focuses on software and data protection, including measures like encryption and access controls. Lastly, administrative security pertains to policies, procedures, and guidelines that ensure the overall security of the system, including employee training and incident response planning.
