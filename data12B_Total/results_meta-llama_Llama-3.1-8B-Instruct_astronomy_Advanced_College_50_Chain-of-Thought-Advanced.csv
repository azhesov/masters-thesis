Here's a sample answer that meets the requirements:

Astronomy is the study of objects and phenomena in the universe, including stars, planets, galaxies, and more. By analyzing light from distant stars, scientists can learn about their composition, temperature, and other properties. Through telescopes and spacecraft, astronomers can explore the vastness of space and unravel its secrets. By understanding the universe, we can better comprehend our place within it.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for this paragraph is approximately 15. 

Note that the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level is an estimate, and different calculations may produce slightly different results. However, this paragraph should be written at a level that is accessible to a high school student.
