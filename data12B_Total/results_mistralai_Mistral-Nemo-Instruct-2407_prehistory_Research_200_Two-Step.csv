Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 200 words. Prehistory is the period before written records, extending from the earliest known human-like species to the invention of writing systems. It spans around 99% of human history. This era is divided into three main periods: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Stone Age is further subdivided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods, marked by significant technological advancements like the use of stone tools, domestication of plants and animals, and the invention of pottery. The Bronze Age is characterized by the use of metal for tools and weapons, while the Iron Age saw the widespread use of iron. Prehistory is studied through archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology, as direct written evidence is lacking. Artifacts, fossils, and architectural remains provide insights into human evolution, migration, culture, and societal development during this time.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Research and limit the output to 200 words:

Prehistory is often divided into Stone Age (Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic), Bronze Age, and Iron Age periods, each marked by technological advancements in tool and weapon making. During this time, humans migrated across the globe, developing complex cultures, social structures, and economies, including agriculture, which laid the foundation for civilization.
