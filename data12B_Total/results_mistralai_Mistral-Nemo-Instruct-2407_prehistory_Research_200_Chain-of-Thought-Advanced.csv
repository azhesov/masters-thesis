**Plan**

1. Use the word 'era' to introduce the topic of prehistory.
2. Explain what prehistory is by comparing it to the historical era.
3. Use 'civilization' to describe human development during the historical era.
4. Use 'hominids' to describe early humans during the prehistorical era.
5. Use 'evolve' to describe the development of hominids.
6. Use 'tools' to describe the technological advancement of hominids.
7. Use'records' to describe the lack of written history in prehistory.
8. Use 'archaeology' to explain how we learn about prehistory.

**Paragraph**

""Prehistory is the era before recorded history. Unlike the historical era, which is marked by the rise of civilizations, prehistory is defined by the evolution of early humans called hominids. Hominids evolved from simpler life forms, developing tools and",8.6,52.36,9.4,10.5,8.2,10.59,4.0,5.3

They left behind clues like stone tools, cave paintings, and even their footprints. Archaeologists, who study these clues, help us understand how our ancestors lived.

Prehistory refers to the vast span of time before written records began. This era stretches back over 3 million years, ending around 3300 BCE. It's divided into three periods: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Stone Age is further split into Paleolithic (Early Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (Late Stone Age). During these periods, humans developed from hunter-gatherers to settled agricultural communities. They created tools, art, and structures, leaving behind tangible evidence of their existence. However, without writing, our understanding of their cultures, languages, and beliefs relies on archaeological and anthropological interpretations. Prehistory is a critical phase in human history, marking the evolution of our species and the emergence of civilization.",9.1,51.04,11.4,11.3,10.46,12.86,4.69,5.0
