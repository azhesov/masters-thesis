Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other.

Prehistory, from the Greek 'pre' meaning before and 'history' meaning study, refers to the period of time before written records were kept. It is the study of human life and culture from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing, around 3,200 BCE. Archaeologists and anthropologists, scholars of human cultures and societies, study prehistoric humans through their artifacts, structures, and environmental impact. They use methods like radiocarbon dating to determine the age of these materials, and compare findings across different regions to understand human migration and cultural exchange. Despite the lack of written records, prehistoric societies left behind rich evidence of their lives, offering valuable insights into the origins and evolution of human culture.",14.6,42.04,18.7,16.4,17.44,13.94,7.21,18.0

Archaeology (from the Greek archaiologia, ""ancient things"") is the primary discipline employed in prehistoric research, as it deals with the excavation and analysis of artifacts, structures, and human remains. These physical remnants are the only sources of information available for understanding the lives and cultures of our ancestors during this period. Prehistoric studies span from the emergence of the first hominids around 6 million years ago to the development of written records, a timeline that encompasses significant events such as the advent of tool use, the control of fire, the emergence of complex societies, and the spread of early humans across the globe. The term 'prehistory' was coined by Danish archaeologist Christian Jürgensen Thomsen in the 1830s to differentiate the unwritten past from historical periods.",15.2,40.52,19.4,16.8,18.29,13.76,7.46,18.0

Prehistoric studies encompass archaeology, anthropology, and paleoecology, and involve the analysis of artifacts, human remains, and environmental data. These disciplines reconstruct human cultures, technologies, and environments, shedding light on the origins and evolution of human societies. Prehistoric research has revealed the development of agriculture, the rise of complex societies, and the spread of early human migrations across the globe.

The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Example 2:
It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 200 words. Prehistory is the period of time before written records began, when humans were not literate. It is studied by archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians. Prehistory can be further divided into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, each characterized by the dominant tools and weapons used by humans during that time. The study of prehistory is a complex and fascinating field, involving the interpretation of artifacts, architecture, and other physical remains, as well as the reconstruction of cultural practices, social structures, and technological innovations. Despite the lack of written records, the study of prehistory provides valuable insights into the origins and early development of human societies, and our understanding of this period continues to evolve as new evidence is discovered and new methods of analysis are developed.",15.9,33.17,18.9,17.1,18.24,13.94,7.29,18.0

Prehistory, from the Greek 'pre' meaning 'before' and 'history', is the study of human life before the advent of written records, generally dated to around 3300 BCE. This period, spanning thousands of years, is known for its rich archaeological and paleontological findings, offering invaluable insights into early human cultures, technologies, and behaviors. Archaeologists and anthropologists are the primary scholars in this field, reconstructing past lives through artifacts, architecture, and environmental evidence. Prehistory is divided into Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, each marking significant shifts in human technology and society. Despite the lack of written records, prehistory is a vital window into our ancestral past, providing context for understanding modern human cultures and their evolution.",15.4,34.6,18.6,16.7,17.63,13.99,7.16,18.0

Prehistory, from the Greek 'protos' (before) and 'historia' (history), is the study of human life and culture before the advent of writing. This period stretches from the earliest humans, Homo habilis, around 2.1 million years ago, to the invention of writing, a process that occurred independently in various civilizations between 3200 BCE and 600 CE. Prehistoric studies involve a diverse range of disciplines, including archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology, as well as geology and biology. Archaeologists and anthropologists piece together human history using material remains, such as artifacts, architecture, and art, while paleontologists study the fossil record to understand the evolution of humans and their ancestors. Despite the lack of written records, the study of prehistory offers invaluable insights into human origins, societal development, and cultural diversity.",15.0,35.71,18.1,16.7,17.26,14.05,7.04,18.0
