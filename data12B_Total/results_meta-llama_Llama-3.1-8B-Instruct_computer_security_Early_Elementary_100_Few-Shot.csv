Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

""Computer security is like protecting your home. You lock your door so bad people can’t come in. Computers need passwords so bad people can’t get in. When you make a password, use letters and numbers. Don’t use your name or a date. If you use your name or a date, it’s easy to guess your password. Bad people can guess your password and get into your computer. They can steal your pictures and games. So, always make a strong password.""

Use your understanding of the complexity and nuance of the topic to adjust the vocabulary and sentence structure to convey the idea that security is a complex process, but also accessible to everyday people.

Here is the example paragraph for computer security targeting early elementary readers:

Imagine your house has special locks on every door. Just like locks keep bad people from getting into your house, computer security keeps bad people from getting into your computer. It's like having a secret code to keep people from getting in. But how do you make a secret code? It's not magic. You use special programs and rules to keep your computer safe. You also have to be careful about what you click on and what you type in. This way, your computer stays safe and secure. Like your house, your computer is like a safe home.

The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.

Computer security helps protect our computers. Hackers are bad people who try to break into our computers. They want to steal our secrets and hurt us. A strong password is like a strong lock. It keeps our computers safe. We must keep our passwords secret and not share them. We must also be careful what we click on when we are on the internet. A computer virus is like a bad germ that can hurt our computers. We must be careful and keep our computers safe. We can ask a grown-up for help if we need it. They can teach us how to be safe.
