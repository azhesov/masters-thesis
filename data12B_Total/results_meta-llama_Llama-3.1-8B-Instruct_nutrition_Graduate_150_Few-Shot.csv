Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Nutrition is the study of the relationship between diet and health, encompassing the biochemical, physiological, and psychological mechanisms by which nutrients affect the body. Physical nutrition is the scholarly and scientific study of the composition, properties, and effects of foods and diets on human health and disease. Nutritional studies examine the impact of nutrient intake on the prevention and treatment of diseases, as well as the development of optimal diets for various populations, such as children, athletes, and individuals with chronic health conditions. Theories in nutritional science may involve both scientific and non-scientific propositions, depending on assumptions that cannot be tested. Nutritional research may be interdisciplinary, involving fields such as biochemistry, physiology, psychology, and epidemiology. Its findings have significant implications for public health policy, food industry practices, and individual dietary choices. As a field, nutrition seeks to understand the complex relationships between diet, health, and disease, and to develop evidence-based recommendations for optimal nutrition.",16.5,26.44,19.1,17.5,17.99,14.86,7.26,18.0

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 150 words. The term ""nutrition"" was first used in English in 1551 in a dictionary by John Palsgrave. It is the scientific study of the nutrients in food and the processes by which organisms absorb and utilize them. The study of nutrition is divided into several branches, including human nutrition, animal nutrition, and nutritional biochemistry. These branches explore the functions of nutrients, the effects of nutrient deficiencies and excesses, and the relationship between diet and disease. Nutrition is also a popular topic of research and interest in the general public, with many people seeking to improve their health and well-being through better nutrition. The study of nutrition has led to a greater understanding of the importance of a balanced diet and the role of nutrients in maintaining health. This knowledge has far-reaching implications for the prevention and treatment of diseases. The field of nutrition is constantly evolving, with new discoveries and advancements in technology continually expanding our understanding of nutrition.

The study of nutrition (from the Latin nutrire, ""to nourish"") is a multidisciplinary field of research that deals with the interaction of nutrients and the organism. Nutritional science is the scientific study of the nutrients and substances that are required for human health and well-being. This field of study is concerned with the origin, synthesis, and utilization of nutrients, as well as the effects of nutrient deficiencies on human health. The term nutrition has been in use since the 15th century and was first used in English in the 17th century. Scientific theories in nutritional science may include both empirical and theoretical propositions and may depend on assumptions that cannot be tested. The study of nutrition has practical applications in the prevention and treatment of various diseases and disorders, and is an essential component of public health policy. The field of study is continuously evolving and requires ongoing research to keep pace with new discoveries.  \\\\

The term nutrition was first used in English in 1550 in John Aylmer's An Harborowe for Faithfull and Trewe Subiectes. It is the scholarly and scientific study of the relationship between diet, nutrition, and health. Nutritionists and dietitians, often working with food scientists, biochemists, and nutrition biochemists, are the scientists who study nutrition. Nutritional biochemistry is a subdiscipline of biochemistry that focuses on the biochemistry of nutrients, including the breakdown and synthesis of carbohydrates, fats, and proteins. Because nutrition is related to health, nutritional science may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested. A healthy diet is a diet that provides adequate nutrition for the needs of an individual, and is an essential component of a healthy lifestyle. Nutrition has become increasingly important in modern times due to the growing awareness of the relationship between diet and health.​​

Nutrition (from the Greek nutrítion, ""nourishment"" and -logía, ""study of"") is the scholarly and scientific study of the process by which organisms (including humans) obtain energy and nutrients from the food they consume, and the balance between food intake and expenditure of energy. Physical nutrition is the study of the body's ability to utilize nutrients for energy and growth. It involves the study of the biochemical processes that take place within the body in response to dietary intake and the study of the factors that influence these processes. Religious or mythological nutrition is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of food and dietary habits. The scientific study of nutrition is conducted by scientists, such as nutritionists and biochemists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of biology, and philosophers of health and disease. Theories in physical nutrition may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions.

The discipline of nutrition, encompassing the scientific study of diet, health, and disease, is a complex and multidisciplinary field. Its study involves not only the physical sciences, such as biochemistry and physiology, but also the social sciences, like psychology and sociology. Nutritionists examine the intricate relationships between nutrient intake, body function, and disease susceptibility. The field has evolved significantly over time, from a focus on nutritional deficiencies to a comprehensive understanding of the role of nutrition in maintaining overall health and preventing chronic diseases. Research in nutrition has led to significant advances in our understanding of the relationships between diet and disease, as well as the development of evidence-based guidelines for healthy eating. The study of nutrition continues to be a vital component of public health, with implications for policy, education, and clinical practice. It is a field that requires collaboration among experts from various disciplines to advance our understanding of the complex interactions between nutrition and human health.

The field of nutrition (from the Latin nutrire, ""to nourish"") is the study of the relationship between diet and health. The term nutrition was first used in English in 1594 in a medical treatise by Richard Huloet. In 1771, the French physician Antoine Paré published the first book on nutrition, in which he discussed the properties of various foods and their effects on the human body. Nutrition is a multidisciplinary field of study, drawing on biology, chemistry, and psychology to understand the physiological and biochemical processes involved in nutrient absorption, metabolism, and excretion. It encompasses not only the study of human nutrition but also the nutrition of animals and plants. Theories in nutrition may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested. The study of nutrition has led to significant advances in public health and disease prevention.  Word count: 149.

Nutrition is the scientific study of the composition of food and how it is absorbed, digested, and used by the body. It is a multidisciplinary field that draws on knowledge from biochemistry, physiology, and other sciences to understand the complex interactions between nutrients and the body's various systems. The study of nutrition is divided into two main branches: human nutrition, which focuses on the nutritional needs of individuals and populations, and animal nutrition, which examines the nutritional needs of animals. Nutritionists and researchers use a range of methods to study nutrition, including biochemical analysis, epidemiological studies, and clinical trials. The findings of nutrition research have significant implications for public health, disease prevention, and the development of new food products. By understanding the intricate relationships between nutrients and the body, nutritionists can develop evidence-based recommendations for healthy eating and optimal nutrition.
