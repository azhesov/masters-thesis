Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

In the beginning, the students were careless with passwords. They would write them down and leave them in plain sight. They didn't understand why passwords were important, and they certainly didn't know how to use them securely. But when they learned about computer security, they began to change their behavior. They started using strong passwords and keeping them secret. They also learned how to use encryption to protect their online information. As they learned, they began to take their security more seriously.

## Step 1: Determine the readability level of the given examples.
The examples are written at an Upper Elementary readability level.

## Step 2: Identify the key vocabulary and structure used in the examples.
The examples use vocabulary such as ""hows"" and ""whys,"" ""why nots,"" ""trajectory path,"" ""glean,"" and ""encryption."" They also use a structure that includes introducing a problem or situation, explaining the solution or action taken, and providing a conclusion or outcome.

Computer security helps protect our digital information from unwanted intruders. Just like a safe has a lock, computers and phones have special codes that only the right people can open. A good computer security system includes strong passwords, firewalls, and antivirus programs. Imagine you're a detective trying to catch a thief. You would want to gather clues and piece together the evidence to catch the bad guy. Similarly, computer security systems work by gathering clues and blocking any suspicious activity to keep our digital information safe.

Security experts, like Mary, worked on coding and testing. She didn't just want to do the work – she wanted to know the 'hows' and the 'whys.' By asking questions, Mary began to stand out. She started noticing that websites had security gaps, and she figured out how to close them. Mary became part of the security team and was recognized as a leader. She helped protect people's online information and kept hackers away. As a result, the company's security improved, and Mary continued to be a valuable asset. She was known for her skills in coding.

Computer security is like closing security gaps on websites. Experts, like Mary, work on coding and testing to find the gaps. They want to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys"" behind the gaps.

Here is a short paragraph about computer security:
""Computer security is very important. Like Ruth gathering grain from the fields, computer users must be careful to protect their information from people who might try to take it. When you're online, hackers might try to sneak into your computer to steal your passwords or private messages. It's like someone following Ruth and trying to take her grain! To stay safe, you should use strong passwords, be careful what websites you visit, and keep your computer up to date with the latest security updates. This way, you can protect your information like Ruth protected her grain."" 

However, I would like to rewrite it using more formal vocabulary and sentence structures found in the examples, whereas the previous one used simpler vocabulary and sentence structures. Here is a revised paragraph:

In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

""Computer security"" is the practice of protecting a computer or network from unauthorized access, use, or damage. Here's an attempt:

As you surfed the internet, you may have heard of hackers. They try to get into computers and steal information. That's why computer security is important. It's like locking your door at home to keep strangers out. When you're online, you need to use strong passwords and keep your software up to date. You should also be careful about the websites you visit and the emails you open. By following these simple rules, you can help keep your computer safe from hackers and keep your information secure. Your parents and teachers can help you learn more.",6.9,72.97,8.3,9.9,8.54,8.23,4.24,7.142857142857142

Here is a paragraph about 'computer security':

The computer security team noticed a suspicious login on the mainframe. They wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys"" behind it. By investigating further, they found out that someone had tried to access the system with a wrong password. They didn't just stop there – they also checked the ""why nots"" and found that the password was a weak one. The team became known for their expertise in security. They began to work with the IT team to strengthen the passwords and protect the system. They ensured that the system was secure and ready for use.  Johnson was part of the team. Johnson became a leader, and the IT team relied on her to have the answers they needed. In 1990, Johnson was part of the team that created a new security system. She calculated the risk of a hacker accessing the system, and then figured out how to prevent it. The new system was a huge success!",6.9,72.87,7.9,9.5,8.51,7.76,4.17,7.142857142857142

Example: 
Computers are very smart. But sometimes, hackers try to break into computers to steal important information. It's like a thief trying to break into a house. They use special tools to try to get past the locks and into the house. But a good computer security system can keep them out. It's like having a strong lock and a security camera. If someone tries to break in, the camera takes a picture of them and the lock keeps them out. The computer security system keeps the information safe.

The computer security system is like a shield that keeps bad people out. It's made up of special tools like firewalls and antivirus programs. These tools help keep the computer safe from hackers who try to break in. They're like a strong door that keeps the bad people out. The computer security system also helps keep track of who is trying to get in and what they're trying to do. It's like a watchful eye that keeps the computer safe.
