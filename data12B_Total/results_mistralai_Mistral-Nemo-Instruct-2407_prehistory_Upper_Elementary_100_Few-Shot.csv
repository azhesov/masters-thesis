As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Before the pyramids of Egypt were built, there was a time called prehistory. In those days, people did not write on paper or use computers. They did not have buildings like we do today. Instead, they lived in caves or built shelters with trees and leaves. They did not have tools like we have now. They made their own tools from stones and bones. This time in history is called prehistory because we don't have many records of what happened. We learn about it from the things people left behind, like pictures on cave walls.",5.6,81.63,7.7,9.1,8.06,7.76,4.01,7.142857142857142

Before written words, people in prehistory used stone tools to survive. They didn't have schools or books to learn from, so they passed down knowledge through stories and actions. They made tools like hand axes and spear points by chipping away at stones. These tools helped them hunt animals, gather food, and build homes.

Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

In prehistory, people didn't use words to share ideas. They used pictures and sounds. These early humans lived close to nature, often moving from place to place. They hunted animals and gathered plants for food. They made tools from stones and bones. Over time, they learned to build fires and make shelters.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 100 words. Prehistory is the time before written records, when humans used tools and language, but no written history exists.

Before written records, in a time called prehistory, humans lived all over the world. They used tools and spoke in languages, but no books or documents were made. This was thousands of years ago, when people hunted and gathered food, living close to nature. They created art and stories, but we can't read them now because they weren't written down. We know about this time by studying old tools and art, and learning about how people lived from their bones and homes.",7.2,71.95,8.6,9.4,8.69,8.41,4.3,7.142857142857142
