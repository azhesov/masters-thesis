Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war.

Nutrition is a broad field that combines the scientific study of food, health, and diet. It is the practice of giving the body the nutrients it needs to function at its best. Nutrition is often divided into two main areas: macronutrients and micronutrients. Macronutrients are the energy-providing nutrients such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, while micronutrients include vitamins and minerals that provide essential functions for the body. Nutrition plays a vital role in maintaining a healthy lifestyle and preventing diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. A well-balanced diet is essential for optimal nutrition.

A diet rich in whole foods, such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains, is the foundation of good nutrition. Nutritional awareness is also a key component of overall well-being, and maintaining healthy eating habits can be challenging in today's fast-paced world. A balanced diet is essential for optimal health and well-being, and individuals must make informed choices about the foods they consume. While nutritional knowledge is crucial, a balanced diet is also a matter of self-control and discipline, as individuals must prioritize healthy options over processed and high-calorie foods. Effective nutrition planning requires a combination of knowledge and self-control.

It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent.

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (College), limited to 100 words. Nutrition is a broad and complex field of study that examines the way in which food and drink influence human health. It encompasses various subfields, including dietetics, nutrition science, and nutritional biochemistry. Nutritional knowledge informs public health policies and guidelines for healthy eating. The goal of nutrition research is to understand how the body utilizes nutrients to maintain optimal health and prevent disease. By doing so, nutritionists can develop evidence-based recommendations for optimal nutrition. This helps individuals make informed decisions about their diet. This promotes overall health. .

Nutrition is a discipline that studies the effects of food and drink on living organisms. The ultimate goal of nutrition is to understand how nutrients influence health. While nutrition can simultaneously enhance health and earn a living for individuals (e.g., becoming a nutritionist), the goals of health promotion and career advancement suggest different nutritional strategies, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. Understanding nutrition can be seen as a defensive posture against resulting health problems, such as disease. Nutrition is a condition of a healthy body, maintained while healthy foods are kept available. Maintaining a healthy diet is a seemingly neutral action taken to protect one’s health.
