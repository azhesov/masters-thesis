Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. (Note: You may not be able to use 100 words, but you should aim to write a complete paragraph.)

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'computer security' to someone reading at the Early Elementary level.
To explain 'computer security' to someone reading at the Early Elementary level, I would need to simplify the concept and use relatable examples. Computer security refers to keeping information safe from people who might want to harm it. This is similar to keeping your toys safe from your brother or sister.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
To make the explanation accessible to Early Elementary readers, I would use simple vocabulary and short sentences. I would also try to use examples that children can relate to. For instance, instead of saying ""hackers,"" I could say ""bad people who want to get into our computer."" I would avoid using technical terms like ""firewalls"" or ""encryption.""

Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. The paragraph should include a main idea, supporting details, and a connection to the main idea.
Computer security is like locking a door to keep something safe. It helps keep computers and the things on them, like pictures and games, safe from bad people. We can use passwords and special codes to lock things up. It's like a secret word that only we know. If someone tries to get into our computer, they won't be able to if we have a good password. That way, our pictures and games are safe from people who might want to hurt them.
Step 4: Read the paragraph and make sure it follows the plan.

When you put in your password, it's like giving the computer permission to let you in. But, sometimes people try to guess the password to get in. That's not good! We need to keep our passwords safe and not share them with anyone. Just like how you keep your house safe, we keep our computers safe with strong passwords.""
Step 4: Read and revise your paragraph to ensure it meets the needs of your audience.
Step 5: Revise the paragraph to make it more engaging and easier to understand.
Here's a revised paragraph:

Step 1: Think about how to explain 'computer security' to someone reading at the Early Elementary level.
To explain computer security to an Early Elementary reader, I would focus on the basic idea of keeping information safe from harm. I would compare it to locking a door to keep unwanted people out or keeping a secret to keep it private.

Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For Early Elementary readers, I would choose simple vocabulary and short sentences. Here are some example words and phrases:

**Step 1: Think about how to explain 'computer security' to someone reading at the Early Elementary level.**
To explain 'computer security' to someone reading at the Early Elementary level, I need to simplify the concept and use relatable examples. I can compare computer security to protecting a treasure chest or a secret garden. Just like how we lock our doors and keep our valuables safe, we need to protect our computers and personal information from bad people who might try to hack into them.

**Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.**
I will use simple vocabulary and short sentences that are easy to understand. I will also use concrete examples and relatable metaphors to help the reader visualize the concept.

We have special passwords to keep bad guys from getting into our computers. It's like a secret code that only we know. We also have special software that helps keep our computers safe from yucky viruses. We have to be careful what we click on and download. This helps keep our computers safe and sound!""

Step 5: If I had more time, I would revise my paragraph to make it more concise and clear. Here's an example of a revised paragraph:
