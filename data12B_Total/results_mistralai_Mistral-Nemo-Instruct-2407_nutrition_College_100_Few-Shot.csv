Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Nutrition, in health and dietetics, is the process of consuming foods and drinks to maintain and enhance body health. It is the intake of nutrients, including proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals, to support growth, maintenance, and repair of body tissues. Proper nutrition, achieved through balanced diets, promotes overall health and helps prevent diseases. However, improper nutrition, such as consuming excessive sugar or lacking essential nutrients, can lead to health issues like obesity and malnutrition.",13.8,38.76,15.9,15.7,14.77,13.41,6.33,17.75

Nutrition is the process by which organisms absorb and utilize food to sustain life. Essential nutrients, like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats, are necessary for growth, maintenance, and repair of body tissues. Insufficient or imbalanced nutrition can lead to malnutrition, with potential severe consequences such as stunted growth or even death. Conversely, overconsumption of certain nutrients can result in obesity and related health issues. Balanced nutrition, therefore, is crucial for overall health and well-being.",12.9,40.99,15.1,15.2,14.2,13.52,6.09,17.75

Nutrition refers to the process of consuming and assimilating food for growth, health, and energy.

Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Nutrition is the process of consuming food and drink for growth, health, and energy. Nutritious foods are those that provide necessary nutrients in suitable amounts. A balanced diet, which includes various food groups, ensures adequate intake of these nutrients. Consuming too much or too little of certain nutrients can lead to health issues. For example, consuming too much fat can lead to obesity, while consuming too little iron can result in anemia.",12.0,48.74,14.5,15.0,13.71,12.71,5.96,17.75
