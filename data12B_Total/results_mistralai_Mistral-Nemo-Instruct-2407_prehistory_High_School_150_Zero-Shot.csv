Prehistory is the period before recorded history, typically defined as before the invention of writing. This era is characterized by the presence of humans, their ancestors, and other hominids. It spans from the emergence of the first hominids around 6 million years ago to the invention of writing systems around 3300 BCE. Prehistory is often divided into several periods, including the Stone Age, which is further split into the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age) eras. Each of these periods is marked by distinct cultural and technological advancements, such as the development of stone tools, the domestication of plants and animals, and the construction of permanent settlements. Archaeologists and anthropologists study prehistory by examining artifacts, fossils, and other physical remains left behind by our ancestors, providing valuable insights into the evolution of human culture and technology.",13.5,34.26,15.7,15.7,16.0,15.03,6.29,11.5

Prehistory, the time before written records, stretches from the beginning of human existence around 2.6 million years ago until the invention of writing, approximately 3400 BCE. This vast period is divided into three main eras: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Each era saw significant advancements in tool-making, technology, and culture. The Stone Age, lasting over 2.5 million years, saw the emergence of early humans like Homo habilis and Homo erectus, who used simple stone tools. The Bronze Age, around 3300-1200 BCE, introduced metallurgy, with societies creating tools and weapons from bronze, marking the start of civilization as we know it. The Iron Age, from 1200 BCE onwards, brought even stronger tools and weapons, leading to the rise of city-states and empires.
