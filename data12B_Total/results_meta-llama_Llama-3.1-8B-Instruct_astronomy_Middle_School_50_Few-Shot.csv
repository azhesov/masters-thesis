In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on.

Please find the rewritten paragraph:

In astronomy, telescopes and observatories enable astronomers to examine far-off stars and planets. These tools help them study the celestial bodies and make notes about their composition and motion. By recording their observations, they can understand the universe better. Astronomers study astronomy to gain a deeper insight into the cosmos.​

The telescopes in the astronomy lab are equipped with advanced sensors and detectors. The data collected is then transmitted to the computer, which processes it, and displays the results on a large screen. The temperature and humidity are carefully regulated to ensure optimal viewing conditions. The atmosphere inside is controlled to prevent distortion. The astronomers use the data to study celestial bodies, stars, and galaxies. They can observe distant worlds, nebulas, and black holes. The data also helps them understand the life cycle of stars, their composition, and the formation of the universe. They also learn about various astronomical phenomena such as solar eclipses, supernovae, and comets. They can even study the motion of planets, asteroids, and comets.

(Note: This is a sample answer. You can modify it as per your requirement.)
Here is a sample answer based on the given instructions:

The planetarium, a place for astronomy, has a special room with controlled air. The air comes from a furnace and is blown around by a machine. The temperature is kept at about 50°, and the air keeps moving steadily. This helps astronomers see the stars and planets clearly. The air is also kept steady to avoid any disturbance. The room is also equipped with a special machine that helps to maintain the temperature and air movement. The astronomers use this room to study the universe and make new discoveries.

Astronomy is the study of celestial objects and phenomena. In observatories, scientists use telescopes to analyze starlight and detect distant planets. Specialized cameras capture images of galaxies and black holes. Astronomers study these images to understand the universe’s mysteries. They also use computer models to simulate celestial events.

Yes, your paragraph meets the requirements. Here are some minor suggestions for improvement:

* Consider starting with a more engaging sentence to grab the reader's attention. For example, ""Have you ever looked up at the stars and wondered what lies beyond our planet?""

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on.

The telescope helps astronomers observe distant stars. They look at these stars through a lens, which magnifies their images. The astronomer also sees light coming from the stars. By looking at the light, the astronomer can tell what the star is made of. They use this knowledge to study the universe.

The astronomers, like the bean and the coal, would not have been able to survive without escaping. They would have been burnt to ashes if they had not escaped the blaze of their passion. The astronomers study the celestial bodies. Their fate would have been sealed if they had not pursued their dreams.

This is an example of a text rewritten to meet the readability level of middle school. To make it more understandable for that level, we should consider the following: 

1.  Use simpler vocabulary. Replace words like ""celestial"" with more familiar terms like ""stars"" and ""planets"".
2.  Shorten sentences to make them easier to follow.
3.  Remove complex sentence structures.
4.  Use more relatable comparisons and metaphors.
