Nutrition, a critical aspect of human biology, encompasses the ingestion, absorption, and utilization of food to sustain life and promote optimal health. It is the process by which the body derives essential nutrients—such as carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals—to maintain growth, development, and overall functionality. Adequate nutrition is not merely about consuming enough calories; rather, it is about obtaining the right balance of nutrients to meet the body's demands. A well-balanced diet, rich in diverse foods, is crucial for preventing nutritional deficiencies and chronic diseases, thereby ensuring long-term health and well-being.",12.5,36.69,15.1,14.6,14.89,15.14,6.31,9.0
