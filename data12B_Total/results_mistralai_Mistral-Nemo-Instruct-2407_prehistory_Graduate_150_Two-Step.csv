The Stone Age, lasting over 2.5 million years, saw humans evolving from Homo habilis to Homo sapiens, developing stone tools, and migrating out of Africa. The Bronze Age, around 3300-1200 BCE, brought significant cultural and technological changes, with metalworking, organized societies, and urban centers emerging. The Iron Age, from 1200 BCE onward, marked further advancements in metallurgy, leading to stronger tools and weapons, and the growth of civilizations.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Graduate and limit the output to 150 words:

The Paleolithic, lasting from around 2.6 million years ago to 10,000 BC, is characterized by the use of stone tools. The Mesolithic, from 10,000 to 8,000 BC, saw the development of more complex tools and the domestication of some plants and animals. The Neolithic, from 8,000 to 3,000 BC, is marked by the transition to agriculture and the building of permanent settlements.

**Summary:** Prehistory, the era before written records, spans from the first humans to the invention of writing. It is divided into three main ages: Stone, Bronze, and Iron. The Stone Age, lasting from 2.6 million years ago to 3,000 BC, saw tool development and transition to agriculture. The Bronze Age (3,300 to 1,200 BC) brought advancements in technology and society, while the Iron Age (1,200 to 500 BC) introduced iron tools and weapons, leading to city-states and complex societies.",8.7,62.68,10.7,12.2,10.48,10.03,4.41,8.285714285714286
