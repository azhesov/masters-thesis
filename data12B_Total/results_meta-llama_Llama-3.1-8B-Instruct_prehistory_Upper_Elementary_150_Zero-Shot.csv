Prehistory is a long, long time ago when humans did not have writing or record-keeping devices. 
This means that we can't read about what people did or thought back then. 
However, archaeologists have found many clues that help us understand how people lived, what they ate, and how they dressed. 
They have discovered tools, buildings, and other objects that show how people survived and interacted with their environment. 
For example, we know that early humans hunted and gathered food, and later, they started to farm the land. 
We also know that they developed shelter, like caves and tents, to protect themselves from the weather. 
Their lives were hard, but they were able to adapt and thrive in many different environments. 
Overall, prehistory is a fascinating time period that helps us understand where we come from and how we got to where we are today. ........",7.6,65.52,9.6,10.9,9.21,10.26,4.4,6.222222222222222

Prehistory is the time before written records. It spans from the emergence of humans to the invention of writing. People during prehistory left behind clues like tools, art, and other artifacts that help us understand their lives. These early humans lived in small groups, hunted for food, and gathered fruits and vegetables. They made tools from stone, wood, and bone to make their lives easier. As time passed, people developed new skills and technologies, like farming and metalworking. This allowed them to settle in one place and build more complex societies. Despite the lack of written records, we can still learn a lot about prehistory by studying the artifacts and remains left behind. By understanding prehistory, we can gain insights into the origins of human civilization and the development of modern society. It's a fascinating period that helps us appreciate the history of our world.

Prehistory refers to the time period before humans began writing and recording their lives. It started around 3.5 million years ago and lasted until the invention of writing, which occurred around 5,000 years ago. During prehistory, people lived in small groups, hunted for food, and gathered fruits and vegetables. They also made tools from stone, bone, and wood. As humans evolved, they developed new tools and techniques, such as farming and domesticating animals. The prehistoric period is often divided into three main parts: the Paleolithic era, the Mesolithic era, and the Neolithic era. Each era saw significant changes in human society and technology. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the early stages of human development and how our ancestors lived and adapted to their environments. It helps us understand our own history and the world around us. By examining artifacts and fossils, we can piece together the lives of our ancient ancestors.

Limit the time period to 2 million years ago to the emergence of Homo sapiens (modern humans). Prehistory is the time period before recorded history. It started about 2 million years ago and ended when humans first began writing things down, about 5,000 years ago. During prehistory, humans were still learning to survive and adapt to their environments. They developed tools and technologies that helped them make a living. Early humans, such as Homo habilis and Homo erectus, roamed the Earth and used crude stone tools. Later, Homo sapiens (modern humans) emerged in Africa around 300,000 years ago. They developed more advanced tools and complex societies. Prehistory is an important time period because it shows how humans evolved and developed over millions of years. It helps us understand how our ancestors lived and what they accomplished.

The time before written history is called prehistory. This was a time when humans first appeared on Earth, and it lasted until the development of writing. 
Prehistory can be divided into three main periods: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. The Stone Age began when humans first used tools made of stone. People during this time used stones to hunt, gather food, and build homes.
The Bronze Age started when people learned to mix copper and tin to create a strong metal called bronze. This metal was used to make tools, weapons, and other useful items. The Iron Age followed, where people discovered iron and used it to make even stronger tools and weapons.
These periods are not exact, but they give us an idea of how people lived and developed over time. Archaeologists study the remains of old civilizations to learn more about prehistory.

Explain the term ""prehistory"" and provide an example of how it relates to everyday life.

Prehistory refers to the time before written records existed. It's like trying to piece together a puzzle with missing pieces. During prehistory, humans lived and built communities, but they didn't leave behind written notes or pictures like we do today. Instead, archaeologists study artifacts like tools, homes, and artwork to learn about the past. For example, imagine you're digging in your backyard and you find a old, rusty shovel. You might wonder who used it, how long ago, and what they were using it for. Archaeologists do the same thing with ancient artifacts, but they have to be detectives and use clues to figure out the story behind each find. By studying prehistory, we can learn about how people lived, what they ate, and how they survived in different times and places. It's like being a time traveler, uncovering secrets from the past!

Prehistory is a time when people first started living on Earth. During this time, people didn't have writing, so we don't have any written records. Instead, we have to look at the things they left behind to learn about them. These things include tools made from rocks, bones, and wood, and the homes they built. We can also learn about the food they ate, the clothes they wore, and the things they believed in. Archaeologists, or treasure hunters, search for these clues to understand how people lived and what their lives were like. They can also look at the animals that lived at the same time to get a better picture of the world. By studying these clues, we can learn about the people who came before us and how they shaped the world into what it is today.

Prehistory refers to the time period before written records existed. This era spanned from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing, which happened around 5,000 years ago. During prehistory, humans lived in small groups and developed basic tools made of stone, wood, and bone. They also hunted for food and gathered fruits, nuts, and seeds. As time passed, humans began to settle in one place and develop more complex societies. They created early forms of art, like cave paintings, and built shelters made of stone and mud. The study of prehistory helps us understand how humans evolved and developed over time. It also teaches us about the early cultures and civilizations that shaped our world today. By learning about prehistory, we can appreciate the rich history of our planet and the incredible achievements of our ancestors.  The study of prehistory is essential to understanding the roots of human culture and civilization.

Prehistory is a long time ago, before written records existed. It's the time when humans first started living on Earth. During prehistory, people made tools from stones, sticks, and bones. They hunted for food and gathered fruits and berries. Early humans also made fire, which helped them cook their food and stay warm. They lived in caves, trees, and even tents made from animal hides. As time went on, people started to draw pictures on rocks and walls, which helped us learn more about their lives. Some of these pictures show animals, like mammoths and saber-toothed tigers, while others show people hunting and working together.

They didn't have a way to record their history, so we have to rely on clues found in the environment and the tools they left behind. These early humans used stone tools, like hammers and knives, to hunt and gather food. They also discovered how to control fire, which helped them cook their food and stay warm.
