Discuss one major aspect of computer security - Firewalls.

A firewall is a crucial component of computer security that acts as a barrier between a computer and the internet. Its primary function is to prevent unauthorized access to or from a private network while allowing authorized communication to pass through. Think of a firewall as a bouncer at a nightclub, only allowing people you know to enter while keeping out strangers. In the digital world, a firewall monitors incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. It can block malicious traffic, such as viruses and hackers, from entering your system, and prevent your system from sending sensitive information to unauthorized parties. By implementing a firewall, you can significantly reduce the risk of cyber attacks and protect your computer from harm. By doing so, you'll be able to browse the internet with peace of mind, knowing your system is shielded from potential threats. Regularly updating and configuring your firewall is essential to maintain optimal security.  - â€” [Computer Security](https://en.wikipedia.org",12.2,37.5,13.6,14.4,13.64,14.27,6.05,10.428571428571429

Computer security is a crucial aspect of protecting digital information from unauthorized access or malicious threats. Malware, short for malicious software, is a broad term that encompasses various types of software designed to harm or exploit computer systems. It can take the form of viruses, worms, or Trojans, which can steal sensitive data, disrupt system functionality, or even take control of the entire system. Spyware, a specific type of malware, is designed to secretly monitor and record user activity, often without their knowledge or consent. It can collect sensitive information such as login credentials, browsing history, and financial data, which can be used for identity theft or other malicious purposes. To protect against these threats, it's essential to install anti-virus software, keep operating systems and software up-to-date, and exercise caution when clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files. Regular backups and security updates can also help prevent data loss and system compromise.... (",12.5,36.79,14.9,14.7,14.54,15.08,6.55,10.428571428571429
