In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

Computer security is a vital part of our online lives. When we use the internet, we send and receive information through the air. This information can be seen by others if it is not properly protected. A firewall is like a strong door that keeps unwanted visitors out of our computer. A virus is like a sneaky mouse that tries to get into our computer and cause harm. If we have good antivirus software, it can catch the virus like a cat catches a mouse. But if the virus is too sneaky, it can get in and cause problems. To stay safe online, we must be careful what we click on and what we download. We must also make sure our firewall is turned on and our antivirus software is up to date. With good computer security habits, we can protect our computers and",6.7,78.69,7.7,8.9,8.76,6.44,4.28,11.0

A group of computers gathered together in a virtual space, wanted to keep their data safe. So they made a firewall to protect them from intruders. But sometimes hackers managed to break through, and the computers were in danger of being infected with viruses. A group of malicious code managed to sneak past the firewall and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' One of the viruses replied: ‘I fortunately spread from another computer, and if I hadn’t escaped by sheer force, my damage would have been limited. I should have been contained by the antivirus software.' The data said: ‘I too have been protected, but if the hackers had gotten me into the hands of a malicious user, I should have been deleted without any mercy, like my fellow data.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to our lot?' said the firewall.

Example of a paragraph:
When we think about computer security, it’s like the bean, straw, and coal thinking about their past. The bean was worried about being made into broth, the coal was worried about being burnt, and the straw was worried about being broken. If a hacker gets into your computer, it’s like a coal being burnt. They can steal your personal information and use it to do bad things. The straw is like your computer’s security system. It’s fragile and can break easily if not taken care of. But, just like the straw, your computer’s security system can be fixed and updated to keep you safe. By keeping your computer’s security system strong, you can avoid being a victim of a cyber attack. It’s like the bean, straw, and coal working together to stay safe and sound.

Computer security is a crucial aspect of safeguarding our digital lives. It involves protecting our computers, phones, and other digital devices from unauthorized access, hacking, and cyber threats. Just like the bean escaped from the old woman's pan, we must take precautions to keep our digital information safe from malicious actors. A secure computer system is like a well-maintained fire, burning brightly without any risk of being extinguished. It is essential to install antivirus software, update our operating systems regularly, and use strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access. Additionally, we should be cautious when clicking on suspicious links or downloading unknown files, as they can compromise our system's security. Just as the straw and coal came together to form a new combination, we can combine various security measures to create a robust defense against cyber threats. By taking these precautions, we can ensure our digital lives remain safe and secure.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 3:
There is an old legend about a man who made a good fortune with a simple device that he invented. He made a small bell that would ring when a person's name was mentioned in conversation. He attached the bell to the wall of a tavern and, as he had predicted, it rang frequently. Patrons were curious and asked the proprietor about the bell. He told them that it was a warning device that signaled when someone was talking about him. Many people were amused by this and paid the inventor a small sum to ring the bell whenever his name was mentioned. The proprietor soon discovered that he was getting a lot of extra business because of the bell and paid the inventor a handsome sum to install a second bell that would ring whenever his name was mentioned. The inventor, pleased with his success, soon found himself with a fortune.

The computer security is like a bean that has escaped being made into broth. It protects the computer from being harmed by bad people. Like the coal, it has jumped out of the fire and has saved itself from being burnt. If the computer security hadn't been there, the computer would have been hacked and its data would have been stolen. Like the straw, it has been saved from being consumed by the bad people. The computer security is like a guardian that keeps the computer safe from all the bad things. It is like a shield that protects the computer from being damaged. It is also like a lock that keeps the bad people out. The computer security is very important because it keeps the computer safe and secure.

A threat to a computer system is like the coal that escaped from the fire. It has been evading detection and damage. Hackers, the old woman, are always trying to sneak into the system and steal information or disrupt operations. But, just like the coal, they can be stopped if they are detected early. The system has security measures in place, like the hot air from the furnace, to prevent unauthorized access. Firewalls, antivirus software, and intrusion detection systems are all part of the security measures. They keep the system safe from threats like viruses and malware. If a threat is detected, it is like the bean that escaped the pan. The system can take action to prevent it from causing harm. In the end, a strong security system is like the dry rooms where the veneer is placed. It keeps the system safe and secure, preventing threats from causing damage.
