Astronomy is the study of objects in space. It involves looking at the sun, moon, stars, planets, and galaxies. Astronomers use telescopes to observe these objects and learn more about them. They can also use computers to analyze data and make predictions about what will happen in the future. Some people think that astronomy is just about looking at the night sky, but it's much more than that. Astronomers can study the universe in many different ways, including by looking at the light that comes from distant stars. This light can tell us about the temperature, composition, and motion of those stars. By studying the universe, astronomers can learn more about the history of the universe and how it has changed over time. This can help us understand our place in the universe and how we fit into it.
