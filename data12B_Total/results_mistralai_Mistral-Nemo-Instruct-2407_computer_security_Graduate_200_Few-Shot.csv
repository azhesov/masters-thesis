Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 200 words. Computer security, also known as cybersecurity, is the protection of computer systems, networks, and sensitive information from digital threats, damage, or unauthorized access. The term was first used in 1980, during a workshop on computer security and privacy. It is studied by professionals such as computer scientists, engineers, and cybersecurity specialists, as well as ethicists and philosophers who explore the moral and ethical implications of digital systems. These professionals aim to understand, prevent, and mitigate cyber threats by employing technical controls, such as encryption and firewalls, as well as non-technical controls, like user education and policy development. As technology advances, so do cyber threats, making computer security an ever-evolving field that requires continuous adaptation and innovation.",15.7,33.78,19.1,17.6,18.13,14.52,7.29,18.0

Computer security, also known as InfoSec, is the protection of computer systems and networks from threats, damage, and unauthorized access. It involves ensuring the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of data. The field has evolved rapidly with the increasing complexity of computer systems and the rise of cyber threats. Physical computer security, for instance, deals with the protection of hardware, while information security focuses on data and software. Both are crucial for safeguarding an organization's assets. However, the balance between security and usability is delicate, as overly stringent measures can hinder productivity. Therefore, computer security professionals must continually adapt to new threats and technologies, striking a balance between safety and efficiency.",14.4,37.13,17.4,16.5,16.65,14.22,6.85,18.0

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 200 words. Computer security, or cybersecurity, is the protection of computer systems, networks, and sensitive information from digital threats, damage, or unauthorized access. It involves the implementation of security policies, procedures, and technologies to safeguard data, maintain confidentiality, and ensure business continuity. The study of computer security dates back to the 1960s, with the advent of the internet and increased reliance on computers for critical infrastructure. However, the term 'computer security' was not coined until the 1970s, reflecting the growing concern over the vulnerability of computer systems to malicious attacks. Today, computer security is a multidisciplinary field, encompassing aspects of computer science, mathematics, and law, and is studied by professionals such as information security analysts, cybersecurity engineers, and computer scientists, as well as legal and policy experts. The study of computer security is not confined to scientific propositions alone, as it also involves ethical and societal considerations, such as privacy and surveillance, which can be subject to debate",17.1,24.71,19.7,18.1,18.4,14.81,7.44,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

The term ""computer security"" was first coined in 1970 by James P. Anderson, a researcher at IBM's Thomas J. Watson Research Center. Since then, the field has evolved significantly, driven by advancements in technology and the increasing reliance on digital systems. Today, computer security encompasses a broad spectrum of practices aimed at protecting computer systems and networks from digital threats, damage, or unauthorized access. This includes, but is not limited to, prevention, detection, and recovery from security breaches, as well as the protection of sensitive information. The study of computer security is interdisciplinary, involving not only computer scientists and engineers but also social scientists, ethicists, and legal experts, given the multifaceted nature of the challenges it faces.",14.5,36.83,17.3,16.4,16.59,13.81,6.86,18.0

Computer security, a vital aspect of cyber science, involves safeguarding computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption. It encompasses protective measures like encryption, firewalls, and intrusion detection. Academics and IT professionals, akin to astronomers and physicists in cosmology, study computer security. Similar to cosmology's blend of scientific and non-scientific propositions, security theories may rely on assumptions that aren't easily testable, such as user behavior. Despite these challenges, the field's importance grows as our reliance on digital systems increases.",14.9,35.81,18.2,16.9,17.23,14.34,7.11,18.0
