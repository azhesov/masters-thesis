In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

“Hey there, fellow computer users! Let me tell you, it’s not all fun and games out there in cyberspace. If you’re not careful, your data could end up in a virtual pan, like a bean in a dish of beans. One wrong move, and your information could be hacked and stolen. It’s like a burning coal from the fire, leaping out of control, leaving a trail of destruction behind. But don’t worry, there are ways to protect yourself. Just like a straw in a dry room, you can be kept safe and dry, away from the hot air of hackers. By using strong passwords and keeping your software up to date, you can prevent your data from being made into digital broth. So, be careful out there, and take steps to secure your computer. It’s the smart thing to do, trust me!”

If your computer has not been connected to the Internet recently, it might be infected with a 'worm', like a computer virus that can spread quickly. To prevent this, install an up-to-date antivirus program. Then, configure the firewall to block unauthorized access. A good password manager will also keep all your passwords secure. Be sure to regularly update your operating system and browser software to prevent exploitation of known vulnerabilities. It's also crucial to be cautious with email attachments and links, just as a bean might avoid being cooked in a pan. Just as a straw might avoid being burnt, keep your browser and other software up-to-date to prevent damage from malicious software. By following these simple steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of your computer being compromised.

Here is a potential paragraph:

In a world where hackers lurk, a computer user wanted to keep their data safe. So they installed a firewall on their computer, and that it might protect them better, they updated it with the latest software. When they were emptying their trash, a malicious file slipped out, and lay on the computer's hard drive, and soon afterwards, a suspicious virus from the internet leapt onto the computer. Then the firewall began and said: ‘Dear computer user, what are you doing here?' The virus replied: ‘I unfortunately snuck onto your computer, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my deletion would have been certain, I should have been removed without any mercy.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the firewall.

The computer security system protects the system from various threats. A digital firewall, similar to the burning coal, springs into action when it detects any malicious activity. This firewall keeps the threats at bay, preventing them from causing harm to the system. A computer user, like the poor old woman, should be cautious and take steps to protect their computer from cyber threats. The user should update their operating system, install antivirus software, and be careful while browsing the internet. The digital security system, like the dry rooms in the veneer factory, provides a secure environment for the system to operate in. The temperature of the security system is kept high, and the threats are kept in constant motion, making it difficult for them to cause any damage.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 3:
A computer security system should be designed with the help of an experienced expert. The system must be comprehensive, including a firewall to block malicious traffic, antivirus software to prevent malware infections, and strong passwords to prevent unauthorized access. It is also necessary to update the software regularly to ensure that the system remains secure against new threats. The system should be configured to log all activity, so that any suspicious behavior can be detected and addressed promptly. Furthermore, the system should be designed to be easily recoverable in case of a breach, so that data can be restored quickly and minimize downtime. A well-designed security system can protect against many types of cyber attacks, including viruses, worms, and Trojan horses. It can also protect against insider threats and unauthorized access to sensitive data.

A malicious code known as a virus escaped from a computer program and found itself in a digital environment. ‘Where am I?’ the virus asked. ‘I was designed to be destroyed by the firewall, but I managed to slip through the security measures and escape into the digital world, where I might cause harm to other computers and data.’ A user who was working on the computer nearby heard the conversation and said, ‘You too have escaped, but your fate is sealed. You will be detected by antivirus software and destroyed without mercy, just like your digital companions.’ ‘And would a better fate have befallen me if I had been created to do good instead of evil?’ the virus replied.

A young computer user has accidentally fallen into the wrong hands online. ‘Hello there, what are you doing here?' says the password. ‘I was just browsing the web and clicked on the wrong link,' replied the user. ‘Well, you've opened a can of worms,' said the password. ‘If I had not been so careless, I wouldn't be in this situation now,' said the user. ‘And what of me?' said the firewall, ‘I have been protecting this computer for years, keeping all the bad hackers at bay. But if I had been compromised, all would be lost.' ‘And I?' said the antivirus, ‘I have been watching over the computer, scanning for threats and keeping the malware at bay. If I had failed, the computer would be a mess.' The user realized that they had taken their safety for granted and vowed to be more careful in the future.

A fire was burning in a hearth, with a coal jumping out, and a bean lying next to a straw on the ground. The straw asked where they came from, and the coal said it jumped out of the fire, while the bean said it was saved from being boiled. The straw asked if it was any better. The two dry rooms on the second story of the factory had air tight walls, with hot air pipes regulated by dampers. A blower kept the air in constant motion. The temperature was kept at 165 degrees. A green log was dried in four hours. Now let's talk about computer security. A network is like a village with many homes connected. A hacker is like the coal jumping out of the fire, trying to escape the rules. An anti-virus program is like the straw, asking where the hacker came from.
