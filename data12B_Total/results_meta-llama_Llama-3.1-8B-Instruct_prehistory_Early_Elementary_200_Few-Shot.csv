warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.

Prehistory is a long time ago. Before history, people didn’t write down anything. But, they made tools and homes. Our ancestors made clubs and stones to hunt. They also made fires to cook. Some people made homes in caves. Others built homes out of sticks and mud. A long, long time ago, people first learned to make tools out of metal. They made swords, knives, and axes. Some people made boats to sail. Others made wheels to move things. People built big homes and made big fires. They hunted big animals like mammoths and bison. A long, long time ago, people first learned to farm. They grew food like wheat and corn. This helped people live in one place. People started to live in cities. This was a big change. People made new tools and homes. They made new clothes. They even made jewelry! Prehistory is a long time ago, but we can still learn about it today.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words.  A long, long time ago, before our parents and grandparents were born, there was a time called Prehistory. During this time, people did not write. They made pictures and left them on the walls of caves. These pictures show animals and people. They also show things that people did a long time ago.  Archaeologists are people who study these old pictures. They want to learn about the people who made them. They study the bones of animals and the tools that people made. They try to figure out how people lived a long time ago. People lived in small groups and hunted animals for food. They made fires and made clothes from animal skins. They were happy and sad, just like us. But they did not have cars or computers like we do today. We know about Prehistory from the pictures they left behind. We can learn a lot about how people lived a long time ago by looking at these old pictures. And we can be happy that we have things that make our",1.8,96.79,2.3,6.5,4.53,3.38,2.53,2.1875

Long, long ago, in a time called prehistory, people lived in caves. They hunted animals to eat and made tools to use. The people who lived during this time didn't have any written language. They didn't know how to write or draw. They told stories by talking and making pictures. The prehistoric people also made homes in rock shelters and in the ground. They built fires to keep warm. People also found and used stones to make tools. They used these tools to cut and hunt animals. Some people even made their own clothes. The prehistoric people were very good at making and using tools. They lived during a time that was very different from today. They didn't have cars, computers, or buildings. They lived a very simple life. The prehistoric people made their own tools and clothes. They lived a long time ago, but we can still learn from them today.  (201 words)

But prehistory is before we had books, pictures, and people who told stories. It is like a big mystery. People lived in caves, hunted animals, and made tools from rocks. They did not have houses like we do. They did not have cars, televisions, or computers. They did not have money or stores. They made their own clothes from animal hides and furs. They made their own food from hunting and gathering. We know about prehistory from the things they left behind. We find their tools, their houses, and their art.

Prehistory is very, very long ago. People were around, but we don’t know their names. They didn’t leave behind buildings like we do today. But they did leave behind tools. Those tools are made of rock and bone. The people used sticks to draw pictures on the walls of caves. Those pictures tell us about their lives. We can learn about their homes, food, and friends from those pictures. The people hunted animals to eat. They also gathered fruits and vegetables. They wore animal skins and made clothes from plants. They made fire and used it to cook their food. The people made their own houses, but they were made of branches and leaves. They were very simple.

Example:
A long time ago, there were people who did not write. They left behind rocks, bones, and footprints. People today are very interested in these things. We can learn about the people who came before us. They made tools, hunted, and gathered food. They made homes from sticks, mud, and leaves. They wore animal hides and furs to keep warm. Some people even drew pictures on rocks. These drawings can tell us what life was like a long time ago. We can learn from their mistakes and successes. We can learn about the world before written history. We call this time ""prehistoric"". We can still learn about the people who lived in this time. We can visit places where they lived and see their tools and homes. We can learn about the animals they hunted and the food they gathered. We can learn about the people who came before us.

Title: The Time Before Written History

Prehistory is a long time ago. Before people could write, they made history by drawing on walls, rocks, and cave walls. The drawings showed what they did. They drew pictures of animals they hunted and things they made. Some of these drawings are still on the walls today. We can learn about the past from these drawings.

We don’t know much about the people who lived a long time ago. But we do know they made things like hammers, knives, and spears. They used rocks to make tools. They also made fires to cook their food and keep warm. People in prehistory also lived in groups, like families and friends. They worked together to survive. We can learn about their lives from the things they made and the places where they lived.

Some of the things they made are still around today. We can see them in museums and in the ground. We can",1.8,96.79,2.4,6.6,4.47,3.5,2.54,2.1875

Some of those things are tools. Tools are things that people used. They made things with them. People made stone tools. They made tools from bones and wood. Some of those tools were very good. They were very sharp. People used them to hunt and to gather food. They used them to make things. People also left behind pictures. They made pictures on walls and on rocks.
