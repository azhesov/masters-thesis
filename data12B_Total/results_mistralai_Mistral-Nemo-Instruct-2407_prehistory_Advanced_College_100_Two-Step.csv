Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 100 words. Before the written history, human societies existed in a state known as 'prehistory'. This period spanned from the first human-like species' appearance around 6 million years ago to the invention of writing systems around 3300 BCE. Prehistory is often divided into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, each characterized by the dominant tools and weapons used. Major events include the migration of early humans out of Africa, the development of complex societies like those in ancient Mesopotamia and Egypt, and the domestication of plants and animals, which led to agriculture and civilization.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limit the output to 100 words:
