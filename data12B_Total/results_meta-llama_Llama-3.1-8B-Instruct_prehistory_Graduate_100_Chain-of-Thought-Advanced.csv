Prehistory refers to the period of time before recorded history began. During this time, humans lived in small groups, often without written language. Early humans developed tools, controlled fire, and began to domesticate plants and animals. The prehistoric period saw the emergence of complex societies, such as ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and the Indus Valley. This time period is often divided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic ages. Archaeologists use artifacts and other evidence to study prehistory. They can learn about the lives and cultures of early humans by examining their tools, artwork, and other remains. The study of prehistory helps us understand how humans evolved and developed over time.

Prehistory is a period of time before written records. It includes the lives of ancient humans who lived before the invention of writing. These people did not leave behind documents like letters or newspapers. They communicated through spoken language and art. Archaeologists study the remains of their homes, tools, and other artifacts to learn about their lives. By analyzing these clues, researchers can piece together a picture of what life was like before written history. The prehistoric period is divided into three main sections: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras. Each era is characterized by distinct cultural and technological developments. Understanding prehistory helps us appreciate the complexity and diversity of human experience.

Prehistory is the period of human history before the invention of writing. This era spans from the emergence of the first humans to the development of written records. It is characterized by the presence of archaeological artifacts, oral traditions, and cultural practices. Before writing, human societies relied on oral storytelling, art, and symbolism to convey information and pass down knowledge. With the advent of writing, prehistory gives way to history, allowing for the preservation of written records and the documentation of human events.

This era is characterized by the emergence of language, culture, and technology. The prehistoric period spanned from the appearance of the first humans, approximately 300,000 years ago, to the invention of writing, around 5,500 years ago. During this time, people lived in small nomadic groups, relying on hunting, gathering, and farming for survival. As populations grew and societies became more complex, the need for cooperation, trade, and governance arose, laying the foundation for the development of modern civilizations.

Here's the plan in detail:

- Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' in 100 words.
We should explain 'prehistory' as the period before written records existed, which includes the entire span of human history before the advent of writing. This is a crucial concept in archaeology and history, as it encompasses the lives of our ancestors, from the earliest stone tools to the development of complex societies.

- Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
To achieve a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 17, we need to use more complex sentences and vocabulary. We should include words like ""span,"" ""advent,"" ""comprise,"" and ""encompass."" We should also use phrases like ""prior to written records"" and ""extensive archaeological evidence.""
