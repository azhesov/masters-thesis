Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. In 2020, human aging is understood as a complex, multifactorial process involving cellular and molecular changes that accumulate over time, leading to functional decline and increased risk of age-related diseases. Key factors include telomere attrition, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, and stem cell exhaustion. Interventions targeting these hallmarks offer promise for healthy aging and longevity.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 100 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. 'Human aging' is a complex biological process involving various cellular and molecular changes that occur over time. Key aspects include telomere shortening, epigenetic alterations, and the accumulation of damaged proteins and cellular waste. These changes contribute to a progressive decline in physiological functions, increased susceptibility to diseases, and a reduced ability to maintain homeostasis. However, aging is not a uniform process, as individual experiences and environments can influence its trajectory.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 100 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. 'Human aging' refers to the progressive physiological and psychological changes that occur in individuals over time, typically after the age of 30. These changes include declines in organ function, increased risk of disease, and cognitive impairments. Aging is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, and is a complex, multifactorial process that remains incompletely understood. While aging is a natural part of life, it is also a major risk factor for numerous diseases and conditions, including cardiovascular disease, cancer, and Alzheimer's disease.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 100 words:
