Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.

Some people like to play games on computers. They can play games at home or at a friend's house. But computers have special passwords to keep them safe. This is called computer security. If a person knows a computer's password, they can use it to play games and do other things. But if a person doesn’t know the password, they can’t play games or do things on the computer. This keeps the computer safe from people who might try to do bad things. Imagine you have a special box with a lock. If you know the lock's secret, you can open the box and take a toy out. But if you don’t know the lock's secret, you can’t open the box and take a toy out. That's kind of like what a password does for a computer. It keeps the computer safe from people who might try to do bad things. So, it's very important to keep your computer's password a secret. Tell someone you trust, like a parent",1.9,96.59,2.1,6.8,4.63,3.04,2.57,2.1875

Computers have a special way to keep our information safe. It is called security. Security helps keep our information from being stolen. Just like a lock on a door keeps our things inside safe, security helps keep our computer safe. Imagine you had a secret code that only you knew. If someone else wanted to get into your computer, they would need the secret code. If they didn’t have the code, they couldn’t get in. That would keep your information safe! Just like Cat and Dog asking the bird, the owl, and the goose to see if they knew about the egg, when you log into a website or a computer, you are asking if you have the right secret code.

The Internet is a big place. There are many people on it. But there are some bad people too. They want to do bad things to our computers. These bad people are called hackers. They can make our computers do bad things too. That is why we need to be safe. We need to have strong passwords. We need to be careful what we click on. We need to tell our parents if someone asks us to give them our password. If you are online, you should always ask a grown-up if it’s okay to do something. 

If you don’t want hackers to get into your computer, you should have a firewall. It’s like a strong wall that keeps them out. You can also use a special program to keep your computer safe.

**Computer Security**

The internet is like a big neighborhood. Just like your neighborhood, there are good things and bad things. On the internet, the bad things are called viruses. They can make your computer sick and hurt it. But you can keep your computer safe with computer security. Computer security is like locking your door to keep the bad things out. You can do this by using a strong password. A password is like a secret code that only you know. You can also keep your computer safe by not opening bad emails and not clicking on bad links. These are like strangers knocking on your door. If you don’t know the stranger, don’t open the door. And if you don’t know the link, don’t click on it. If you do these things, you can keep your computer safe and healthy. Just like how you take care of your body, you can take care of your computer.

Here are the steps to keep your computer secure:
First, make sure you have a strong password. This is like a secret code that only you know. It should be long and hard to guess. Then, keep your computer up to date. This means you need to install new updates regularly. These updates are like fixes for your computer that make it stronger. Next, be careful when you go to websites. Some websites can harm your computer if you visit them. Make sure you visit safe websites only. If you get a message that says your computer is infected with a virus, don’t click on it. A virus is like a bad germ that can harm your computer. Instead, call a grown-up for help. Finally, keep your computer in a safe place. This means you shouldn’t leave it alone in a public place where someone could take it or damage it. By following these steps, you can keep your computer safe and secure.

Here is a good place to start:

Imagine a castle with a big wall. The wall is very strong. Inside the castle, there are many treasures. The wall protects the castle from thieves. But if the wall is weak, the thieves can get in. Then the thieves can steal the treasures. Computer security is like the wall of the castle. It keeps our computer safe from bad people. These bad people want to steal our computer or get the information on our computer. They are like thieves. We can keep our computer safe by using strong passwords. This is like having a strong wall. We also need to be careful when we click on things on the computer. This is like being careful when we walk through the castle. We don’t know if there is a thief hiding. If we are careful, we can keep our computer safe.

Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words. 
Computer security is like a strong lock on a door. Just like how you need a key to open the lock, a computer needs a secret code to let someone use it. This code is called a password. If you make a strong password, it’s like using a strong key. It keeps bad people from getting into your computer. But if you make a weak password, it’s like using a weak key. It’s easy for bad people to open your door and get into your computer. That’s why you need to make strong passwords. You can use a mix of letters and numbers to make it strong. You can also change your password often to keep it safe. Remember, a strong password is like a strong lock. It keeps your computer safe from bad people. So, always make strong passwords and keep them safe!

Computers are very important. They help us. But sometimes we forget things. We forget passwords. That is a problem. Hackers are bad people. They try to guess our passwords. They can guess our passwords if they know our names, birthdays, and pets. They can guess our passwords if they know our favorite foods. They can even guess our passwords if they know our addresses. Then they can get into our computers. They can delete our pictures and messages. They can steal our information. That is very bad. We need to keep our computers safe. We need to make strong passwords. We need to keep our names, birthdays, and pets a secret. We need to tell a grown-up if we see a hacker. We can make a password with numbers, letters, and symbols. We can change our passwords often. That will keep our computers safe. We can be safe if we remember our passwords and keep our information secret. Then we can use our computers without fear.
