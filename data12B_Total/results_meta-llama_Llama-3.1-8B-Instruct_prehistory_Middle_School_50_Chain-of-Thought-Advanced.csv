Prehistory is the time before written records. Humans lived and developed without leaving behind documents. This period lasted from the emergence of humans to the invention of writing. It's a time of discovery and growth, shaping the world we know today. Prehistory is a journey through the past, uncovering the mysteries of early human life. We learn about it through artifacts, fossils, and oral traditions. The study of prehistory helps us understand our ancestors and how they lived.

The final answer is: 

Before history was recorded, human beings lived on Earth. This period is called prehistory. It began when humans first appeared, about 6 million years ago. During this time, people hunted and gathered food, built shelters, and made tools from stone and wood. They also developed languages and societies. The earliest civilizations emerged in Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China. Prehistory lasted until the invention of writing, which marked the beginning of recorded history. The study of prehistory helps us understand how humans evolved and developed complex societies. It also reveals how people lived and interacted with their environments in the past. By studying prehistory, we can gain a deeper understanding of our own history and culture. The study of prehistory is essential for understanding human evolution, cultural development, and the history of our species.

The final answer is: 
Before written records existed, people lived, hunted, and gathered food. This period is called prehistory. It includes all the time before people wrote down their experiences and events. This time span is estimated to be about 99% of the time humans have been on Earth. The remaining 1% is known as history, the time period after written records began. During prehistory, people lived in small groups, often in caves. They made tools from stones and used fire for warmth and cooking. As time passed, people developed new technologies, such as metalworking and agriculture. These changes helped to shape the course of human history. With the invention of writing, people could record their thoughts, ideas, and events, marking the beginning of history. In essence, prehistory is the story of human survival and development before the advent of written records. (Word Count: 96, Sentences: 6, Syll",6.4,68.67,8.8,9.8,7.68,10.36,3.8,5.1

Here's how to explain prehistory in 50 words at Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level 8:

Prehistory refers to the time before written records existed. During this era, humans developed tools, hunted, and gathered. They built shelters and communities. As societies grew, trade and conflict increased. Prehistory is divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic ages. Each had unique characteristics and developments.

Vocabulary:
- prehistory (noun): the time before written records existed
- developed (verb): to create or make something new
- tools (noun): objects used to accomplish a task
- hunted (verb): to chase and kill animals for food
- gathered (verb): to collect things, like fruits or berries
- shelters (noun): buildings or structures providing protection from the elements
- communities (noun): groups of people living together
- societies (noun): groups of people with shared interests and goals

Here is the pre-written text:
Prehistory is the time period before recorded history. This time period is not well understood and is hard to learn about because there are no written records from this time. It is the time of early humans, who lived in caves and developed tools and languages. Archaeologists study this time period by finding and analyzing artifacts left behind by these early humans.

The first humans, called Homo sapiens, lived on Earth a long, long time ago. Before people knew how to write, they made pictures on rocks and in caves. These pictures showed animals, people, and events that happened. People also made tools from stones and bones. They used these tools to hunt and gather food. As time went on, people learned to make more tools and build homes. The earliest homes were made from sticks and mud. Eventually, people developed writing and started to leave behind written records. This marked the beginning of history, when people could write down their stories and share them with others. The time before writing is called prehistory.
