Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 200 words.  “The field of computer security has become increasingly important in today’s digital age. When a user logs onto a computer, a secure connection is made to protect their information. However, hackers can use software and other tools to access a computer's system and steal sensitive information. In 2017, a massive hack affected millions of people worldwide, leading to identity theft and financial loss. This incident highlighted the need for computer security measures to prevent such breaches. Users must be vigilant and use strong passwords, keep their software up-to-date, and be cautious when clicking on links. Furthermore, companies must implement robust security systems to safeguard their customers' data. By taking these steps, individuals and organizations can protect themselves from cyber threats and maintain a safe online environment.”

(Note: The following paragraph is an example of how to write the paragraph. It is not part of the task.)

Computer security is like a secret code that protects our information on the internet. Just like how you lock your door to keep your house safe, computer security helps keep our information safe from hackers. A hacker is like a thief who tries to steal your secrets. They try to find a way to get into your computer and get your information. But with computer security, it's like having a super-strong lock on your door that the thief can't open. It keeps your information safe and secure. Some people are like computer security guards, they help make sure that the information on the computers is safe and that no one can get into it without permission. They make sure that our information is kept safe and sound.

Computer security is like a strong fence around a field. Just as the field needs protection from intruders, computers need protection from hackers. Hackers are like thieves who want to steal information and cause trouble. A strong fence keeps the thieves out and keeps the field safe. Similarly, strong computer security keeps hackers out and keeps the information safe.

Just as farmers need to watch over their fields, computer users need to watch over their computers. They can do this by using strong passwords and being careful when clicking on links. Just as the reapers in the field gather up the grain, computer users can gather up information and keep it safe. And just as the rich man, Boaz, had a lot of grain in his field, computer users have a lot of information to protect. So, they need to be like Ruth, who worked hard to gather up the grain and keep it safe.

Here's a sample paragraph about 'computer security' for Upper Elementary students:

As people use computers more and more, they store lots of information on them. They might have pictures, emails, or even passwords that help them get into their favorite websites. But, have you ever wondered how some people can get into these computers and see or even change the information? Some people, like hackers, try to find ways to break into computers. They might use special tools to guess passwords or find ways to sneak into the computer when nobody is looking. But there are things we can do to keep our computers safe, like using strong passwords and being careful about what links we click on. By",8.1,69.62,10.0,10.3,9.56,8.99,4.57,7.142857142857142

Example paragraph: 
As hackers worked to break into the computer system, they were thwarted by the firewalls and antivirus software. But they didn't give up. They wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots"" of computer security. By learning about the latest technologies, they were able to stay one step ahead. They became known for their expertise in encryption and began to work with top security teams. Eventually, they were recognized as leaders, and their colleagues increasingly relied on them to have the answers they needed. The security team knew when and where they wanted to block the hackers, but the tricky part was to stay ahead of them. The security expert figured it out!

Here's a key:'security' = protection against unauthorized access
Example:
Computer security is like having a super-safe lockbox. Just like a lockbox, computers have special codes and passwords that only the owner can know. This keeps the computer safe from people who might try to break into it and steal information or harm the computer. To keep their computer secure, people should use strong passwords that are hard to guess, and make sure they are not sharing their password with anyone. They should also update their computer regularly to make sure it has the latest security features. Just like how we lock our doors and windows at home, people need to lock their computers to keep them safe from hackers and other bad people who might try to get into their computer. With computer security, people can rest easy knowing their computer and their information are protected.

Example paragraph:

Computer security is the way we protect computers from bad people who want to hurt them. This is like locking doors and windows to keep our homes safe. We have special software that helps keep our computers safe from viruses and other bad things that might get inside. This software can find problems before they become big problems. It's like having a superhero that protects our computers. We also have passwords, which are like secret codes that only we know. This way, even if someone tries to get into our computer, they won't be able to because they won't know the secret code. It's like keeping our homes safe from burglars by locking the door and keeping the key in a safe place. By being careful and using good computer security, we can keep our computers safe and secure.
