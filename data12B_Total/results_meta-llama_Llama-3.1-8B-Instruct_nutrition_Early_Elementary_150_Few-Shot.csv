Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Food is important. It gives us energy. We need energy to play, run, and have fun. We need different foods to be healthy. Food has nutrients. Nutrients help our bodies. They help us grow. They help us feel strong. But some foods have more nutrients than others. Fruits and vegetables are good choices. They have lots of nutrients. They help us feel better. Some foods don’t have as many nutrients. They can make us feel sick. We should eat a rainbow of foods. This means we should eat foods that are different colors. Eating a rainbow helps us get all the nutrients we need. We should ask a grown-up for help. They can tell us which foods are good choices. They can help us make healthy choices. Healthy choices make us strong and happy. We need to eat well to be healthy and strong.  The end.

Our bodies need food to give them energy. The food is called nutrition. We eat food, and it gives us the energy to move and have fun. If we don’t eat enough food, we might feel tired or sick. But if we eat the right food, we feel happy and strong. Some foods are good for our bodies. They help us grow big and healthy. Other foods are bad for us. They might make us feel sick. We need to eat the right foods to keep our bodies healthy. Our bodies are like cars. Cars need gasoline to move. Our bodies need food to move too. We should eat food that is good for us. We can eat fruits and vegetables. They are good for us. They help us grow big and strong. We should not eat too much candy. It is not good for us.

What is nutrition? Nutrition is food for our bodies. Food gives us the energy to play and have fun. When we eat fruits and vegetables, our bodies get healthy. They grow strong. They get the right amount of food. We need a good balance of food. Our bodies need a mix of healthy foods. This mix is called a healthy diet. Our bodies use food to build new things. Like our skin and hair. They use food to fix things that are broken. Like when we fall and get a boo-boo. Our bodies use food to help us feel happy and not feel sick.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. The body needs food to have energy. Food is made up of three kinds: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates give the body energy. Proteins help build strong bodies. Fats help keep the body warm. The three kinds of food are good for us. But some foods are better for us than others. If you eat a lot of candy and ice cream, you will feel tired. That’s because candy and ice cream don’t have any of the good things the body needs. But if you eat fruits, vegetables, and nuts, you will feel strong and healthy. Fruits and vegetables have good things that help keep us healthy. Nuts have good fats that keep us warm. So, we should eat a lot of fruits, vegetables, and nuts. This will help us feel good and strong.

Nutrition is what our body needs to stay healthy. It is like filling up our car with the right kind of gasoline. If we put the wrong kind of gasoline in the car, it won’t run well. If we don’t eat the right kind of food, we won’t be healthy. Fruits and vegetables are good for us. They help keep our bodies working properly. Bread, rice, and pasta are good too. But some foods are not good for us. Junk food and candy are bad for us. They can make us sick. Eating too much of them can hurt our bodies. So, we need to eat good food to stay healthy.

Nutrition makes our bodies strong. It gives us energy to run and play. But some foods give us more energy than others. Pretend you eat a candy bar. You might feel a little stronger, but it wouldn’t last long. Now pretend you eat a bowl of oatmeal. You would feel stronger for a longer time. That’s because oatmeal gives us energy for a longer time. Some foods are easy to digest. That means they are easy to turn into energy. Carbohydrates are good for us. They are in foods like oatmeal and fruits. They give us energy that lasts. See for yourself! Try eating a piece of fruit and a carbohydrate food. See how you feel. Do you feel stronger for a longer time?  The fruit will give you energy for a little while, but the oatmeal will give you energy for a longer time. That’s nutrition!
