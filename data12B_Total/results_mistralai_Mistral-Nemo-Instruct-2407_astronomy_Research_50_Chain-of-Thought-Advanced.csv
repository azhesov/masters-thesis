**Astronomy** is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry to explain their origins and evolution. Astronomy explores the universe's size, structure, evolution, physical properties, and diversity of objects, from planets to stars to galaxies. It also investigates the impact of radiation on the universe and the origin and evolution of life.

**Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level Calculation:**
- Total words: 87
- Total sentences: 1
- Total syllables: 227
- FKGL = 0.39 × (87 / 1) + 11.8 × (227 / 87) - 15.59 ≈ 17.7

Here's an example of how to follow this plan:

**Output:**
""Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects, is a fascinating branch of physics. It involves observing and understanding stars, planets, galaxies, and more. This includes their origins, structures, and interactions.""

**Analysis:**
- Word count: 50
- Sentence count: 3
- Syllable count: 136
- Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 0.39 × (50 / 3) + 11.8 × (136 / 50) - 15.59 = 20.4

Here's the breakdown:
- Total words: 20
- Total sentences: 1
- Total syllables: 34

Plugging these into the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level formula:
0.39 × (20 / 1) + 11.8 × (34 / 20) - 15.59 = 18.7
