When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Example Paragraph:
Computer security is like protecting your home. Just as you lock your door to keep people from coming in, you need to lock your computer to keep bad people from getting into it. But how do you keep the bad people out? The first step is to make a strong password. A strong password is one that is hard for anyone to guess. Think of a word that is hard for others to think of, and don't use your name or your birthday. Next, you should update your computer with the latest security software. This software helps protect your computer from viruses and other bad things that can harm it. And finally, you should be careful about what websites you visit and what links you click on. By following these steps, you can help keep your computer safe from bad people.

Here's a short paragraph about computer security targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary):

As hackers worked on ways to break into computer systems with the other tech experts, they would ask questions. They didn't want to just find a way in — they wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, they began to stand out. Computer security specialists were not allowed to attend meetings with the male hackers and scientists. They wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the threats, so they went. They became known for their training in coding and began to work with teams made up of men and women. Eventually, they were recognized as leaders, and the hackers and scientists increasingly relied on them to have the answers they needed. Specialists like these are the ones who keep our computers and online information safe!

The field of computer security is like a vast, green meadow. Security experts must navigate through it to protect people's digital lives. They must find the hidden threats, like stray grains of corn, that can harm a computer system. The experts know that hackers are always trying to steal or damage digital information. Just like the busy reapers in the field, security experts must keep a close eye on the computer system to prevent any harm. If a security expert notices something suspicious, like a grain of corn that has fallen unnoticed to the ground, they can take action to protect the system. By doing so, they can keep people's digital information safe and secure. Just like Ruth in the field, a good security expert is always on the lookout for potential threats.

Here's a quick start:
When we surf the internet, we are constantly at risk of hackers and viruses that can harm our computers. They can steal our passwords and personal information, and even take control of our devices. But there are ways to protect ourselves. We can install firewalls, which are like walls that block unwanted visitors. We can also use antivirus software, which is like a special kind of guard that keeps our computers safe. And we should always be careful about the links we click on and the emails we open, as these can be ways for hackers to get into our computers. By following these simple steps, we can help keep our computers and personal information safe.

As computers began to do more things on their own, users started to notice something. Their computers would sometimes get strange messages asking for passwords or showing weird screens. People were confused and didn't know what was going on. This was a problem because hackers had found a way to break into the computers. Hackers are like thieves who try to steal information from computers. They use special tools to sneak into the computers and take what they want. But a computer security expert named Mary was on the case. She studied how hackers work and found ways to stop them. Mary taught others how to keep their computers safe from hackers. She showed them how to create strong passwords and how to use special programs to protect their computers. Now, people can feel safer when they use their computers.

Just like how a lock on a door keeps our belongings safe from unwanted visitors, computer security helps keep our digital belongings safe from unwanted visitors on the internet. Just like how you might lock your bike with a strong chain, computer security uses strong passwords, codes, and special devices to keep hackers from getting into our computers. Hackers are like sneaky thieves who try to steal our passwords and use them to access our digital belongings. But with strong computer security, it's much harder for them to get in. Just like how a strong lock keeps our belongings safe, strong computer security helps keep our digital belongings safe from hackers.

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Computers are like houses, and computer security is like locking the doors and windows. It keeps bad guys from getting in. A computer program, or software, is like a key that locks the doors. If the software is good, it keeps the bad guys out. But if the software is weak, the bad guys can get in. They can then do bad things to the computer and the information on it.
To keep the computer safe, we need to make sure the software is good. We also need to make sure we don't give the bad guys the key. We can do this by being careful with our passwords and not giving out our information to people we don't know. We also need to keep our software up to date, like keeping our house's locks updated with new keys. This way, the bad guys can't get in, and we can keep our computer and our information safe.

Computer security is important because it keeps our information safe. Just like how you lock your bike when you leave it outside, we need to lock our computer to keep our information from being stolen. There are many ways to steal information from computers, like hacking. Hacking is like breaking into a house through an open window. To keep from getting hacked, we need to install special software on our computer, like a lock on the window. This software will keep the bad guys from getting in and stealing our information. Just like how the police help keep our streets safe, computer security experts work hard to keep our computers safe. They help us install the locks and make sure they are working properly. By following their advice, we can keep our information safe and secure. This is why computer security is so important.",7.0,72.56,8.4,10.2,8.41,8.52,4.14,7.142857142857142

**The first 2 sentences need to be written. Here is the starting point:**

When computer users want to make sure their online accounts and personal data are safe, they need to use strong passwords and keep them private. This is because hackers are constantly trying to guess or steal people's passwords to get into their accounts and steal their information.

**Your paragraph should explain the 'why' of computer security.**

...so users need to stay one step ahead of hackers by regularly changing their passwords and not using the same password for multiple accounts. By using two-factor authentication, which requires both a password and a special code sent to their phone, users can add an extra layer of protection to their accounts. This helps prevent hackers from getting in even if they guess the password. Users should also be careful about the websites they visit and the links they click on, as some websites may try to trick them into giving away their password or installing malware on their computer.
