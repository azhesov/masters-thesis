Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 150 words. Prehistory is the period of time before written records existed. It is a time of great change and development for human societies. Prehistoric humans lived in small, nomadic groups and were hunter-gatherers, relying on the natural environment for food and resources. Over time, they developed more complex societies and began to domesticate plants and animals, leading to the development of agriculture. This marked a significant shift in human history, as it allowed for the growth of settled communities and the emergence of social hierarchies. Prehistoric humans also developed tools, language, and culture, laying the foundation for the complex societies that would follow. Despite the lack of written records, archaeologists and anthropologists have been able to reconstruct a picture of prehistoric life through the study of artifacts, fossils, and other evidence. This allows us to glimpse the lives of our ancient ancestors and understand the early stages of human development.

Here is a rewritten version of the text, limited to 150 words and at a readability level of high school:

Prehistory refers to the time before written records existed. It was a period of great change and development for human societies. Early humans lived in small, nomadic groups and relied on hunting and gathering for food. Over time, they developed more complex societies and began to farm the land, leading to the growth of settled communities. This marked a significant shift in human history, as it allowed for the emergence of social hierarchies. Prehistoric humans also developed tools, language, and culture, laying the foundation for the complex societies that followed. Despite the lack of written records, archaeologists and anthropologists have reconstructed a picture of prehistoric life through the study of artifacts, fossils, and other evidence. By studying the past, we can gain a deeper understanding of human development and the lives of our ancient ancestors.

Prehistory is the time period in human history before written records existed. It spans from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing. During this time, people lived without written language, and their history is known through archaeological findings, oral traditions, and other non-written sources. Prehistory is divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). In these periods, humans developed tools, language, and social structures, leading to the formation of complex societies. The end of prehistory marks the beginning of the historical period, when writing was invented and history was recorded.

The period can be divided into several sub-periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. Each of these periods saw significant developments in human culture, technology, and society. The Paleolithic period is characterized by the use of stone tools and the development of early human societies.
