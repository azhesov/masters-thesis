**Middle School Level Rewrite:**

Prehistory is the time before people wrote things down, from the first human-like beings to when writing was invented. It's broken into three big parts: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The Stone Age has three parts too: Old Stone Age, Middle Stone Age, and New Stone Age.

Here are some big things that happened:
- The first humans, called Homo sapiens, appeared in Africa about 300,000 years ago.
- People spread out and lived all around the world.
- In the New Stone Age, people started growing their own food and taking care of animals.
- By the end of prehistory, people were living in cities and forming big civilizations.

To learn about prehistory, scientists look at old things people made, bones from a long time ago, and stories passed down from one generation to another. It helps us",9.0,62.07,11.6,11.8,10.25,10.96,4.64,10.5

In simpler terms, prehistory is the time before people could write down their history. It starts about 300,000 years ago and ends when different civilizations invented writing, around 3400 BCE in some places and 1200 BCE in others. During this long time, humans changed from wandering hunters to farmers living in one place. They built amazing structures like Stonehenge, and we learn about their lives from things they made and places they lived. Even though we can't read their stories, we can still learn about these early societies by studying what they left behind.",10.6,52.39,14.3,13.5,12.77,14.16,5.46,13.2

Prehistory is the time before we had writing. It started about 6 million years ago and ended around 5,200 years ago. This time is split into parts: the Stone Age (which has three parts itself), the Bronze Age, and the Copper Age. During prehistory, humans changed a lot. We first appeared in Africa around 300,000 years ago. Then, we spread all over the world. We learned to live in groups and find food together. We also started farming.

Middle School Version:

Prehistory is the time before people could write things down. It starts with the first humans and goes until people learned to write. This time is split into three big parts. The first part, the Stone Age, lasted a very long time. Early humans like the ones we call Homo habilis lived then. They used simple stone tools to hunt and gather food. The next part, the Bronze Age, was when people learned to make tools from bronze. This made stronger tools and weapons. The last part, the Iron Age, was when people started using iron for tools. This made even stronger tools and helped create bigger, more complex societies. So, prehistory is like a story of how people went from living simple lives to creating",7.1,66.94,10.0,10.2,8.37,11.06,3.93,7.25
