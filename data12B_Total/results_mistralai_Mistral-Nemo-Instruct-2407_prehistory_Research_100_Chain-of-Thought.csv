**Prehistory**, often referred to as the 'Stone Age', is a broad period spanning from the first emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago until the invention of writing, roughly 5,000 years ago. It's characterized by the absence of written records, necessitating the use of archaeology, anthropology, and paleoenvironmental evidence to understand human cultures and behaviors. Prehistory is divided into three main epochs: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). Each era is marked by distinct technological advancements, cultural shifts, and environmental adaptations.",10.9,46.17,14.2,13.2,13.26,14.32,5.7,11.166666666666666

Plan:
Explain 'prehistory' as a time period before written records, characterized by human activities such as hunting, gathering, and early forms of agriculture. Use formal vocabulary like 'antedate', 'indeterminate', 'pervasive', and 'pioneering'.

Paragraph:
Prehistory, an indeterminate epoch antedating written records, encapsulates a pivotal phase in human development. This era, marked by the pervasive pursuit of hunting and gathering, witnessed the gradual evolution of societal structures. Pioneering advancements, such as the dawn of agriculture, began to reshape human lifestyles, setting the stage for the advent of civilization.",11.4,39.63,14.1,13.4,13.15,15.13,5.38,7.875

Prehistory, the period before written records, is often associated with the Stone Age, which is divided into three eras based on technological advancements: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). Each era saw significant developments in human society, including the emergence of nomadic hunter-gatherer groups in the Paleolithic, the advent of semi-sedentary societies in the Mesolithic, and the transition to settled agricultural communities in the Neolithic. Despite the lack of written records, archaeologists and anthropologists have reconstructed this period through the analysis of artifacts, architecture, and environmental data, providing valuable insights into the origins and evolution of human culture and technology.",16.1,21.94,18.7,16.5,17.91,16.48,7.03,13.6

Prehistory, a term coined by French archaeologist Daniel Wilson in 1851, denotes the span of human existence before written records emerged. This era, spanning from the first hominids to the invention of writing, is categorized into Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages based on dominant tool materials. Archaeologists and anthropologists, using methods such as stratigraphy, carbon dating, and artifact analysis, reconstruct the lifestyles, cultures, and technological advancements of these pre-literate societies. Prehistory is thus not merely the absence of written history, but a rich tapestry of human experience waiting to be unraveled through empirical evidence.",12.4,37.0,14.2,13.8,14.46,14.56,6.08,8.142857142857142

Prehistory, a term coined by the French historian Thureau-Dangin, refers to the time before written records, an era often associated with archaeology. This period, spanning from the earliest human-like species to the invention of writing, is typically divided into Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages. It's characterized by technological advancements and cultural shifts, with humans transitioning from nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled agricultural societies. Prehistory is crucial for understanding human evolution, migration, and the origins of civilization.",11.3,39.94,13.5,13.4,13.76,14.78,5.52,8.428571428571429
