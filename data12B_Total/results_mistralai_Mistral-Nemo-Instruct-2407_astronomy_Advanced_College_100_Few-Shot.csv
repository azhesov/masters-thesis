Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere, has captivated human curiosity since antiquity. It involves numerous aspects, including optical and radio astronomy, astrophysics, cosmology, and planetary science. This vast field explores the universe's origins, evolution, and ultimate fate, delving into mysteries such as black holes, dark matter, and exoplanets. Observations are made using sophisticated telescopes and spacecraft, while theoretical predictions are tested through mathematical models and simulations.",15.8,28.17,18.1,17.2,17.92,14.63,7.33,19.25

Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena, has long captivated human curiosity. From ancient civilizations who tracked the stars for navigation and farming, to modern space exploration, our fascination with the awe-inspiring cosmos remains undiminished. Telescopes, from Galileo's primitive spyglass to today's advanced instruments, have allowed us to peer deeper into the universe, revealing galaxies, black holes, and even evidence of exoplanets.
