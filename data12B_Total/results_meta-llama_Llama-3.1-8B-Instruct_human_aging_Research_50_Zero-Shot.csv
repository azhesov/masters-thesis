Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Telomere shortening, epigenetic changes, and cellular senescence contribute to declining physical and cognitive functions. As individuals age, they experience a gradual loss of homeostatic balance, leading to increased susceptibility to age-related diseases and reduced quality of life. Research has shown that aging is not solely a product of chronological time, but also of cumulative damage and epigenetic drift, highlighting the potential for intervention and mitigation strategies. Understanding the aging process can inform the development of novel therapeutic approaches to promote healthy aging and extend lifespan. [Limit: 50 words] [Readability Level: Research].
