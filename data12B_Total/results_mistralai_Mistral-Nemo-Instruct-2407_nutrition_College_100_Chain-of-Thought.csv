Nutrition, in the context of higher education, can be defined as the science that studies the relationship between food and health. It encompasses the process of ingesting, assimilating, and utilizing nutrients to maintain optimal physiological functioning and prevent malnutrition. The field of nutrition delves into understanding the dietary requirements of different individuals, the effects of various foods and beverages on the body, and the consequences of dietary imbalances. Moreover, it explores the role of nutrition in preventing and managing chronic diseases, such as diabetes, heart disease, and certain cancers. Nutrition science also involves research into the impact of food production, processing, and preparation methods on the nutritional content and quality of foods. This multifaceted discipline, therefore, is crucial for promoting health and well-being in individuals and populations.",12.4,37.1,15.1,14.8,15.02,15.77,6.31,10.285714285714286
