In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In computer security, a firewall blocks unauthorized access. A virus scanner inspects files for malware. Encryption codes protect data. Firewalls and scanners must be regularly updated to stay effective. If they fail, the system may be compromised, and sensitive information could be stolen. Constant updates are necessary.   ​

Example 1 is a classic German folktale. It features an old woman who cooks beans, a coal, a bean, and a straw as the main characters. They talk to each other, describing their fates in life and how they would be treated if they were not able to escape their current situations. This tale has a strong moral about how we all must work hard to survive. The story starts with the old woman and the bean, then the coal joins in. The straw is the last to join the conversation.

This could be catastrophic, like the old woman’s dish of beans. Firewalls should be kept strong, like the hot air pipes in the dry rooms, to prevent a security breach.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 50 words. 

Computer security measures ensure data protection. When an unauthorized person attempts to access sensitive information, a firewall alerts the user. The intrusion detection system identifies the threat and isolates the system. Encryption keeps data safe by scrambling it into unreadable code, safeguarding it from cyber attacks.

### Step 1: Determine the main topic
The main topic is 'computer security'.

### Step 2: Identify the key concepts
The key concepts are data protection, firewall, intrusion detection system, encryption, and cyber attacks.

### Step 3: Use vocabulary and structure from the examples
Use simple vocabulary and structure similar to the examples to explain the concepts. For example, use'measures' instead of'strategies', 'alert' instead of 'notify', and'safeguard' instead of 'protect'.

### Step 4: Write the paragraph
Here is the paragraph about 'computer security' using vocabulary and structure from the examples:

The computer security system protects the computer from unauthorized access. It uses a complex algorithm to decode the password. If the password is correct, the computer is unlocked. If not, it remains locked. The system also monitors the computer for any suspicious activity. It alerts the user if anything unusual occurs.  The security system prevents hackers from accessing the computer. 

In this response, I will use vocabulary and structure similar to the examples to write a short paragraph about computer security.

Example 1:
The computer security system is like the old woman’s beans, which she wanted to protect from harm. So, she created a strong password, like a fire, that only allows authorized access. If an unauthorized user tries to access, the system responds like the burning coal, by alerting the user of suspicious activity.

Just like the veneer is dried in the dry rooms, computer data is protected by the security system. It is placed in a safe, air-tight container, where",8.3,69.31,9.5,10.5,9.5,8.18,4.64,11.0

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 50 words. The computer system uses a 'firewall' to prevent unauthorized access, 'encrypting' data to protect it from being read, and a 'virus scanner' to detect malicious programs. This combination of security measures helps safeguard the computer's sensitive information.  The system is also regularly 'updated' to maintain optimal security. 

Here is a paragraph with 50 words or less:

The computer system uses a strong 'firewall' to protect against hackers. Data is 'encrypted' to keep it safe from being read. A 'virus scanner' detects and removes malicious programs. The system is regularly 'updated' to keep it secure and safe from online threats. This keeps sensitive information secure.
