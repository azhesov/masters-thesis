Nutrition is the scientific study of how living organisms obtain and process the nutrients they need to survive. Nutrients are substances that provide energy, promote growth and repair, and maintain body functions. They include carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, which are absorbed through the digestive system and distributed to cells throughout the body. A diet that provides adequate amounts of essential nutrients is crucial for maintaining overall health and preventing chronic diseases, such as heart disease, diabetes, and obesity. Proper nutrition also supports physical and mental performance. (100 words)

Nutrition is the scientific study of the relationship between diet and health. It encompasses the biochemistry of nutrient absorption, utilization, and excretion. Nutritionists examine the effects of various diets on the body's physiological and biochemical processes. They analyze the nutrient content of foods, assessing their caloric, macronutrient, and micronutrient values. By understanding the interactions between diet, genetics, and environment, nutritionists provide evidence-based recommendations for maintaining optimal health and preventing chronic diseases. This field of study has evolved to incorporate social, cultural, and economic factors influencing food choices and nutritional outcomes.

The essential process of nutrition involves the breakdown of nutrients from the food we consume, enabling our bodies to derive the necessary energy and raw materials to sustain life. This complex process is initiated by the teeth, which break down food into smaller particles, making it easier for the digestive system to absorb the nutrients. The digestive system, consisting of the mouth, esophagus, stomach, small intestine, and large intestine, works in tandem to extract the essential components of food, such as carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, and distribute them to the body's cells for energy and growth. Proper nutrition is vital for maintaining optimal health.
