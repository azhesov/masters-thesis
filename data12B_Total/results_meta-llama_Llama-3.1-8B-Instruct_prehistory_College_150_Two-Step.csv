What is prehistory?
Prehistory is the period in human history that began about 6 million years ago and ended around 5,000 years ago. During this time, humans developed from small, nomadic groups to complex societies with agriculture, cities, and specialized labor. The period is divided into three main eras: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic era saw the emergence of early humans, who used tools made of stone, bone, and wood. The Mesolithic era saw the development of more sophisticated tools and the beginning of agriculture. The Neolithic era saw the rise of settled societies and the development of complex social structures.
