Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. 'Human aging' is a complex, progressive process characterized by a decline in physiological functions, increasing risk of diseases, and a higher likelihood of death. It's influenced by both intrinsic factors (genetic makeup, cellular damage over time) and extrinsic factors (environmental stressors, lifestyle choices). Key changes include reduced organ function, weakened immune system, increased inflammation, and alterations in hormone levels. Chronological age doesn't always correlate with biological age, as individuals can age at different rates due to various factors. Research focuses on understanding the underlying mechanisms, identifying biomarkers of aging, and developing interventions to slow, halt, or even reverse the aging process.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Middle School and limit the output to 200 words:

Human aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by progressive, gradual changes in the body over time. It is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetics, and extrinsic factors, like environment and lifestyle. Key physiological changes include declines in muscle mass, bone density, and cognitive function. Age-related diseases, like cardiovascular disease and Alzheimer's, also become more prevalent. Aging is associated with cellular senescence, telomere shortening, and oxidative stress, all of which contribute to the breakdown of tissues and organs. Longevity is influenced by various factors, with genetics accounting for about 25%.

Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by a progressive decline in functional reserve and an increased risk of disease. The exact causes are not fully understood, but are believed to be a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Telomere shortening, DNA damage, and cellular senescence are among the key cellular changes associated with aging. As we age, our bodies experience numerous changes, including a decrease in muscle mass and bone density, a decline in cognitive function, and an increase in chronic diseases such as heart disease, diabetes, and Alzheimer's. The cardiovascular system, for instance, shows age-related changes like atherosclerosis, which can lead to heart attacks and strokes. The nervous system experiences neuronal loss and a decline in cognitive function, while the musculoskeletal system loses muscle mass and bone density, leading to sarcopenia and osteoporosis.
