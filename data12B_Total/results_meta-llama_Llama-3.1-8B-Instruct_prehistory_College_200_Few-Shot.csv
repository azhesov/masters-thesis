Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Prehistory is the time period before written history. It is the era when early humans first emerged and developed, leading up to the advent of written records. This period is often characterized by the discovery of fossils, artifacts, and other relics that provide clues about human culture and development. Prehistory can be divided into three distinct periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each marked by significant advancements in technology and society. The Paleolithic era is the earliest period, marked by the development of tools and the emergence of early human societies. The Mesolithic era saw the introduction of new tools and hunting techniques, while the Neolithic era is characterized by the advent of agriculture and the rise of complex societies. By studying prehistory, archaeologists can gain valuable insights into the origins of human civilization and the evolution of human societies. This understanding can provide a foundation for understanding the present and future of human societies. The prehistoric period is a critical component of human history, and its study continues",13.4,39.87,15.2,15.7,14.47,13.41,6.08,17.75

Prehistory is the period of human history that spans from the emergence of the first humans until the invention of writing. This period encompasses the development of early human societies, cultures, and technologies. In this era, humans transitioned from a nomadic lifestyle to one of settled agriculture and the establishment of permanent communities. Prehistory saw the emergence of various tools and technologies, such as the wheel and the bow, which revolutionized the way humans lived and interacted with their environment. The period also witnessed the rise of complex societies, such as ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia and Egypt, which laid the foundation for the development of modern societies. Prehistory is a period marked by significant cultural, social, and technological advancements that laid the groundwork for the complex societies that exist today.

Prehistory is the time span before written history began in a given region or culture. This period is often characterized by the development of early human societies, including the use of tools and the emergence of complex social structures. The primary sources for understanding prehistory are archaeological findings, oral traditions, and written records left by other cultures. These sources provide clues about the evolution of human cultures and the activities of early humans, including their migrations, subsistence strategies, and technological advancements. Despite the limited availability of written records, prehistory is a rich and dynamic field of study, offering insights into the lives of our ancestors and the development of modern human societies. The study of prehistory has shed light on the origins of agriculture, the domestication of animals, and the emergence of complex societies, among other significant events in human history. By examining the artifacts and remains of prehistoric cultures, researchers can reconstruct the lives of early humans and gain a deeper understanding of the human experience.

It is the time of human history before the advent of written records, and is usually divided into three main periods: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During this time, humans developed tools, language, and social structures, and began to domesticate plants and animals. The Paleolithic period is characterized by the use of stone tools, while the Mesolithic period saw the introduction of more sophisticated tools made from materials such as bone and antler. The Neolithic period is marked by the development of settled agriculture and the emergence of more complex societies.

Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Prehistory is the period of human existence before written records. It spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the advent of writing. This period is often divided into three main eras: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic era is characterized by the use of stone tools and the hunting-gathering lifestyle. The Mesolithic era saw the development of more sophisticated tools and the beginnings of agriculture. The Neolithic era marked the transition to settled agriculture and the emergence of complex societies. Prehistory is a time period that is shrouded in mystery, with much of our knowledge derived from archaeological discoveries. Despite the lack of written records, prehistory is an essential part of understanding human history and the evolution of our species. The study of prehistory has provided valuable insights into the development of human societies, cultures, and technologies, and continues to be an area of ongoing research and discovery. Prehistory is a crucial period in human history that has shaped our modern world.",12.9,41.09,14.4,15.1,13.72,12.88,5.91,17.75

Prehistory is the period of human history before written records began, which can be difficult to determine. Archaeology has provided valuable information about prehistoric societies through excavation and analysis of artifacts, remains, and other cultural remnants. The study of prehistory encompasses the early periods of human existence, from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the advent of written records, with estimates varying between 300,000 and 50,000 years ago. The primary goal of prehistory is to reconstruct the lives and societies of prehistoric humans, providing insights into the development of human culture, technology, and social structures. The underlying aim is to understand how prehistoric societies interacted with their environment, managed resources, and responded to challenges, ultimately revealing the complexities and mysteries of human history. The study of prehistory has contributed significantly to our understanding of human evolution, migration, and adaptation, as well as the early development of agriculture, architecture, and other significant human achievements.

Prehistory can be defined as the time period before written records were available. It is the period when the first humans began to inhabit the earth and when they developed the earliest forms of civilization. The various stages of prehistory are often referred to as Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. Each of these stages marks a significant shift in human society, such as the development of new tools and the emergence of complex societies. The period of prehistory lasted until the advent of writing, around 5,000 years ago. The study of prehistory is significant because it helps to understand the evolution of human societies and the development of the first civilizations.
