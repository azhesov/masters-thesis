Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?"" But the owl says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose. Maybe it is her egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, ""Is this your egg?""

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

A computer's security is important. It protects your information. Like a village, a computer has guards. These guards check who comes in. They stop bad people. A bad person might try to steal your information. The guards say, ""No, you can't come in."" If a guard lets a bad person in, the computer might get sick. Then your information could be lost. So, always use strong guards to protect your computer.",1.5,97.7,1.8,6.8,4.45,2.86,2.46,2.1875

Computers are like houses. They have important things inside, like family photos or secret messages. Some people might want to steal these things. To keep them safe, we use locks, just like on a house door. For computers, these locks are called security software. It helps protect our computers from bad guys trying to steal our stuff. We also need to be careful not to leave our computers unlocked when we're not using them. Just like we wouldn't leave our house door open when we go on vacation!",1.7,97.09,2.4,6.9,4.69,3.56,2.66,2.1875

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 100 words. Explain in simple terms why keeping a computer password safe is important, and what might happen if someone finds it out.

A computer has secrets. You keep them safe with a password. This password is like a special key. Only you should know it. If you tell someone else, they could use your key to look at your secrets. They might move or change things in your computer. They might even lock you out! So, keep your password safe. Never share it with others.",1.6,97.5,1.8,6.4,4.22,2.8,2.47,2.1875

Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?"" But the owl says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose. Maybe it is her egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, ""Is this your egg?"" But the goose says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the two ducks. Maybe it is their egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the two ducks. They ask the two ducks, ""Is this your egg?"" But the two ducks say, ""No, that is not our egg."" Then the egg breaks.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Computer and Phone communicate. They share secrets. But hacker wants their secrets. So, they try to break in. Computer and Phone ask for help from security expert.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 100 words. Here's a possible version:

A computer is like a house. It has many important things inside. These are called data. Just like you lock your house to keep things safe, you need to lock your computer too. This is called computer security. A strong lock keeps bad guys out. On a computer, a strong password is like a strong lock. It helps keep your data safe from bad guys. Always use a strong password to protect your computer.",1.6,97.5,1.8,6.7,4.33,2.74,2.49,2.1875

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 100 words. Here's a hint: use ""hackers"" as the main noun.

Hackers try to break into computers. They want to steal secret information. But good computer security stops them. It's like a strong lock on a door. It keeps hackers out. To have good security, use strong passwords. Change them often. Don't click on strange links. That's like letting a stranger into your house. Be careful!",1.5,97.8,1.8,6.5,4.43,2.62,2.47,2.1875
