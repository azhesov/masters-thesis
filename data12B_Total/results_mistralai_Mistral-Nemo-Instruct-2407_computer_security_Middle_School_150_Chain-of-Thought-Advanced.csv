Computer security, or cybersecurity, is like protecting a castle from intruders. Just as a castle has walls and guards, a computer has firewalls and antivirus software. These tools help keep hackers, who want to steal information or cause trouble, out of your computer. It's also important to use strong passwords and keep your software up-to-date to make your computer's defenses even stronger. In simple terms, computer security is about keeping your computer and the information on it safe from bad guys.",8.1,58.89,10.1,11.5,9.18,11.47,4.29,5.7

**Output:**

Computer security, or cybersecurity, is like protecting your home from burglars. It's about keeping bad guys out and protecting your valuable data. Computers can be hacked if they're not secure, just like a home can be broken into if it's not locked. To keep computers safe, we use passwords, update software, and install security programs. This is like locking doors, installing alarms, and having a watchdog at home. Without these protections, our computers and data could be stolen or damaged, just like our home and belongings could be taken or harmed if it wasn't secure.
