warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 50 words. 
Prehistory was a long, long time ago. Before history started, people lived. They lived in caves and made fire. They hunted animals and grew food. They made tools from rocks and wood. They were our ancestors. We don’t know much about them, but we know they lived a long time ago.  ## Step 1: Determine the target readability level and the specific requirements.
The target readability level is Early Elementary, which typically corresponds to a 4th-grade reading level. The requirements include a paragraph about 'prehistory' that is 50 words or less and uses vocabulary and structure from the provided examples.

## Step 2: Identify key concepts and vocabulary related to prehistory.
Key concepts include 'prehistory,' 'ancestors,' 'caves,' 'fire,' 'hunting,' 'growing food,' 'tools,' and 'rocks.' Vocabulary from the examples will be used to make the text more engaging and accessible.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 50 words. 

Prehistory is when humans lived before written history. People hunted and gathered food. They made tools from rocks and sticks. They built homes from mud and leaves. Our ancestors lived like this a long, long time ago. They didn’t leave any written records, so we can’t read about their lives. But archaeologists can dig up their things and learn about them. 

This paragraph has a readability level of approximately 60-70, so I would adjust it to be more elementary-friendly by using simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences:

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 50 words. 

Prehistory is the time before we had written records. People lived in villages, and made tools from stone, bone, and wood. They hunted animals and gathered fruits and berries. They didn’t have cars, phones, or computers. We know about prehistory by looking at old things they left behind.  ​

## Step 1: Identify the key elements of the given examples.
The examples provided demonstrate a narrative structure, starting with a setting and then introducing a problem or question that is gradually solved or answered through a series of interactions with various characters.

## Step 2: Determine the vocabulary and structure required for the paragraph about 'prehistory'.
Given the examples, we should use simple vocabulary and a narrative structure to explain 'prehistory'. The paragraph should start with a setting (time before written records), introduce the people and their activities, and then conclude with a reflection on how we know about this time period.

Prehistory is a long time ago. People didn’t write things down. They made pictures on rocks. They hunted animals for food. They made fire. They had a hard time. People lived in caves. They didn’t have houses like we do. They didn’t have clothes like we do either. They had to be brave.  People were different then. They had different things. They made tools from sticks and stones. They didn’t have cars or computers. They walked and ran. They had to be strong. They were very brave. They made our world.  We are their descendants. We have their tools and ideas. We use them every day.  We are very lucky. They made our world and gave us many things. We should be thankful to them. They made us who we are. They gave us their knowledge. We use their tools.

They made tools and homes. They left behind clues for us to find.  People were different back then. They wore animal skins and used stones. They made fires and cooked food.
