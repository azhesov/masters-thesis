Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities.

The study of nutrition, a vital component of health and well-being, encompasses the biochemical and physiological aspects of diet and nutrient intake. Akin to cosmology, its scope is multidisciplinary, engaging fields of biochemistry, physiology, and pharmacology to elucidate the intricate relationships between nutrition, metabolism, and disease prevention. ​
The term nutrition was first coined in 1898, when French chemist Antoine Béchamp used it in his work, to describe the study of the relationship between diet and health.​
Physical nutrition is a science that is studied by researchers, nutritionists, and health professionals, who seek to understand the complexities of human nutrition, and to apply this knowledge to improve human health and well-being.​
​Religious or mythological nutrition is a body of beliefs that have been used to explain the origin of food, the relationship between food and health, and the ultimate goal of nutrition, which is to promote physical, mental, and spiritual well",16.5,31.75,19.6,17.5,18.13,13.94,7.33,18.0

Nutrition is the scholarly and scientific study of the dietary needs of organisms. It is a multidisciplinary field drawing from biology, chemistry, psychology, and philosophy. Nutritionists explore how nutrients are absorbed, utilized, and interact with the human body. This knowledge informs dietary guidelines and informs public health policy. 
The term nutrition was first used in 1902 by the United States Bureau of Chemistry.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 50 words. The term nutrition was first used in the 17th century. Today, it is the study of the relationship between diet and health, encompassing food science, biochemistry, and physiology. Nutritionists and dietitians apply scientific knowledge to develop dietary guidelines and advise on healthy eating. Scientific studies on nutrition aim to explain the underlying biological mechanisms. Theories in nutrition involve both scientific and non-scientific propositions and depend on assumptions that cannot be tested. The field of nutrition has a rich history and continues to evolve with advances in technology and research. 
The history of nutrition is closely tied to the history of food production, agriculture, and human migration. Early societies believed that a healthy diet was crucial for physical and mental well-being, and that certain foods were sacred or taboo. With the advent of scientific inquiry, nutrition became a distinct field of study, with the discovery of vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients.

His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Nutrition is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, and dynamics of food and diet in human beings, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities. The term nutrition was first used in 1902. It is studied by scientists and philosophers. Theories in nutrition may include scientific and non-scientific propositions. 
Note: The paragraph is extremely short and not very informative, I've tried to emulate the style, however, it's challenging to produce a 50-word paragraph on a topic like nutrition that has a similar style to the examples. 

If you want to write a more informative paragraph, I'd be happy to assist you with that.

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Nutrition (from the Latin nutrire, ""to nourish"") is the scientific study of the interaction between diet and the health of an organism. It is an interdisciplinary field, drawing from biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, psychology, sociology, anthropology, agriculture, and economics. Nutrition is crucial for human development and health.

Here is a revised paragraph about 'nutrition' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 50 words. 

The interdisciplinary field of nutrition investigates the complex relationship between diet and organism health. Drawing from biochemistry, physiology, and other sciences, nutritionists examine how nutrients interact with the body. Nutrition plays a vital role in human development and health, influencing growth, disease prevention, and overall well-being. Its significance extends beyond individual health.

Nutrition is the scholarly and scientific study of the properties of food, how the body utilizes them, and the ways in which diet influences health and disease. The study of nutrition is conducted by scientists and scholars. It is a branch of biology and biochemistry. 
Answer: 
The study of nutrition is a scholarly and scientific pursuit, encompassing the properties of food and how the body utilizes them. Conducted by scientists and scholars, it examines the influence of diet on health and disease, bridging biology and biochemistry.
