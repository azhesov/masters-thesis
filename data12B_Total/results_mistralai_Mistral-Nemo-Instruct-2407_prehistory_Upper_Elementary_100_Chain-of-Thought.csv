**Answer:**

In the far-off past, long before anyone wrote books or built cities, people lived in a world we call 'prehistory.' Imagine walking through a dense forest, hearing only birds singing and wind rustling leaves. No cars, no houses, just nature's music. These early people didn't use money or have jobs as we do today. They hunted animals and gathered fruits for food, made their homes from materials they found, and lived close to nature. They left behind clues about their lives, like pictures drawn on cave walls, but no written records. So, we use these clues and our imagination to learn about their fascinating world.",6.2,74.79,8.6,8.6,8.09,9.33,3.91,5.333333333333333

Prehistory is a long time ago when people didn't write things down. It's before we had books, newspapers, or even computers to keep records. This time period is often called 'before history' because we can't read about what happened. Instead, scientists study things like old bones, tools, and pictures drawn on cave walls. These help us learn about how people lived, what they ate, and how they interacted with nature during this time. So, prehistory is like a big mystery that we're slowly solving by finding clues from the past.",6.5,73.98,8.8,9.4,8.78,9.45,4.11,6.5

Step 1: To explain 'prehistory' to an Upper Elementary reader, I'll describe it as the time before written history, when humans used tools and had simple societies.

Step 2: Appropriate vocabulary could include: 'before', 'written', 'history', 'tools','simple','societies'. I'll use short, simple sentences and avoid complex structures.

Step 3: Prehistory is the time before written history. In this era, humans used tools to hunt, gather food, and build shelters. They lived in small, simple societies called tribes or clans. There were no books, so we don't have records of this time. Archaeologists study tools, art, and other remains to learn about prehistory.

Step 4: My paragraph is clear, concise, and uses appropriate vocabulary. The sentence structure is simple and easy to understand",7.8,59.8,9.8,10.2,7.39,10.88,3.81,7.125
