In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 100 words. Prehistory is the period of time before written records, where people used tools made from stone and wood, and lived in caves or simple shelters.

In the past, long before books were written, there lived people we call prehistoric. They used tools made from stone and wood, not metal like we do now. These tools helped them hunt, gather food, and make their homes. They lived in caves or simple shelters they built themselves. Life was tough, but they found ways to survive without writing anything down. That's why we call this time 'prehistory'.",7.8,75.95,9.7,8.5,9.54,7.37,4.56,11.0

In the dawn of time, before words were written, humans roamed Earth like our ancestors, the apes. They lived in caves, hunted animals with sticks and stones. They didn't have books or computers, but they had brains, big and strong. They learned by watching, listening, sharing stories around fires. Their tools, their art, tell tales of their lives. These tales, found in caves and on bones, are our first history, from when Earth was young and wild.",7.4,76.96,9.3,8.6,9.31,7.43,4.5,11.0

Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two.

In prehistory, our ancestors lived without writing. They communicated through spoken words and pictures. They hunted and gathered food. Tools were made from stone, wood, or bone. Life was tough, and many died young. No one knows exactly what happened, as there are no written records. We learn from archaeological finds like fossils and ancient art.",7.2,77.57,9.0,8.6,9.18,7.49,4.5,11.0
