Computer security, or cybersecurity, is the protection of computer systems, networks, and sensitive information from digital threats, damage, or unauthorized access. It involves implementing measures to prevent, detect, and respond to cyber attacks, such as malware, phishing, and hacking attempts. These measures can include using strong passwords, keeping software up-to-date, encrypting data, and educating users about online risks. Effective computer security is crucial for safeguarding personal and organizational data, maintaining privacy, and ensuring the reliable functioning of computer systems.",12.9,30.26,15.3,14.4,14.56,16.47,6.62,8.857142857142858

""Computer security, at its core, is akin to protecting a fortress, ensuring its walls remain intact and unwavering in the face of external threats. Just as a fortress requires robust defenses and vigilant guards, a computer system needs effective security measures and constant monitoring to safeguard its valuable data. These measures can range from complex encryption algorithms to simple user awareness programs, all aimed at preventing, detecting, and responding to potential cyber-attacks. Thus, computer security is not merely about installing anti-virus software, but a comprehensive approach that involves every user, every device, and every aspect of a computer system's operation.""",13.4,34.36,15.4,14.8,14.58,14.62,6.67,11.5

Computer security, at its core, is about protecting computers and their networks from unauthorized access, misuse, or disruption. This involves identifying and addressing vulnerabilities, which are weaknesses that can be exploited by threats, such as malware or hackers. These threats can compromise data, disrupt services, or even take control of systems. To mitigate these risks, computer security employs various solutions, including encryption for data protection, firewalls to control network access, and regular software updates to patch vulnerabilities. Ultimately, computer security is an ongoing process that requires vigilance and continuous adaptation to evolving threats.",12.8,30.46,15.1,14.7,14.51,16.53,6.23,7.875
