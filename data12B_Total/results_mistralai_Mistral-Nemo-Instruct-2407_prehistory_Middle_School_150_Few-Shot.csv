In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 150 words. Prehistory is the study of human life and activities before the invention of writing. It includes the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age.

In prehistory, people lived without books or writing. They used tools made of stone, bronze, or iron. This was long before we had cars or computers. To learn about these times, scientists study old tools, paintings, and bones. They even look at how people lived with animals and nature. It's like a big puzzle, where each piece tells a story of our ancestors' lives.",7.4,77.06,9.1,8.8,9.44,7.25,4.51,11.0

Prehistory refers to the time before written history, so we can't use any sources from that time, but we can describe what life might have been like.

In prehistory, people lived in small groups called tribes. They didn't have buildings like we do today, so they made shelters from things they found in nature, like leaves and animal hides. They didn't have tools or weapons made of metal, so they used stones and wooden sticks. To find food, they hunted animals and gathered plants. At night, they sat around fires to keep warm and tell stories. This is how people lived thousands of years ago, before anyone wrote down their history.",8.1,75.24,10.0,8.7,9.69,7.31,4.65,11.0

In prehistory, people used tools made from stones and bones. They hunted animals and gathered plants. They lived in caves or built simple homes. They did not write or keep records. So, we don't know much about their lives. Some people think they communicated through drawings on walls. These drawings show animals and symbols. They may have been used for storytelling or magic.",7.0,78.08,8.6,8.5,8.87,7.37,4.34,11.0

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In prehistory, humans did not write or keep records. They lived in small groups, called tribes. These people were hunters and gatherers. They found food by chasing animals and gathering plants. They did not use metal tools. Instead, they made tools from stone, bone, and wood. They also made shelters from natural materials. They had no laws or governments. They made their own rules and solved problems together. Life was difficult, but they learned to live in harmony with nature.",6.7,78.79,8.4,8.8,8.95,7.19,4.33,11.0

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Middle School), limited to 150 words. Prehistory is the period before written records began.

Prehistory, much like the beans and straw in the old woman's kitchen, has no written records. It's like a tale told by the earth itself, without letters or words. Early humans lived during this time, just like how the beans and coal lived through their own adventures. They left no books, but they did leave signs. These signs are like the straw and coal next to the bean. They can be found in caves, on stones, and in the dirt. Scientists study these signs, just as the straw and coal talked to the bean, to learn about prehistory. It's like a story told by the earth, waiting to be discovered.",7.5,76.66,9.1,8.6,9.35,7.08,4.48,11.0
