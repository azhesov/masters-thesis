Astronomy, a branch of physics that encompasses the study of celestial bodies, phenomena, and the universe at large, is a fascinating field of scientific inquiry. It involves the observation and interpretation of electromagnetic radiation, such as visible light, infrared, ultraviolet, and X-rays, to understand the physical properties of celestial objects and their interactions. Astronomers use a variety of techniques, including spectroscopy, photometry, and interferometry, to analyze this data and gain insights into the nature of stars, planets, galaxies, and the fundamental laws governing the cosmos. Additionally, astronomy plays a crucial role in our understanding of the origin and evolution of the universe, with significant contributions to cosmology and astrophysics.",15.0,24.78,17.0,16.1,17.38,15.78,6.84,12.166666666666666
