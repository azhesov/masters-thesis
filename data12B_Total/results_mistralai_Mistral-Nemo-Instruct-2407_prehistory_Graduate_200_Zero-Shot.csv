Prehistory, the period before written records, spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. It's characterized by the Stone Age, divided into the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). Each era brought distinct advancements, from simple tools to complex societies. The Paleolithic saw the use of stone tools, while the Mesolithic introduced more refined tools and the domestication of wild plants and animals. The Neolithic brought significant changes, including agriculture, pottery, and permanent settlements, marking the transition to history. Archaeologists study prehistory through artifacts, architecture, and cultural remains, providing insights into human evolution, migration, and societal development.",12.9,30.26,15.9,15.2,16.48,17.22,6.21,10.285714285714286

Prehistory, the period before written records, spans from the dawn of humanity until the advent of writing systems. It's divided into three eras: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. During the Stone Age, early humans, like Homo habilis and Homo erectus, used stone tools and migrated out of Africa. In the Bronze Age, humans developed metallurgy, creating tools and weapons from bronze. The Iron Age followed, with iron replacing bronze for tool-making. These eras saw advancements in culture, technology, and societal structures, shaping the world into what we recognize today.",8.5,57.87,11.2,11.9,12.09,12.58,5.22,7.5

Prehistory, the period before written records were kept, is a fascinating era in human history. It spans from the emergence of the first humans around 2.6 million years ago to the invention of writing systems, which occurred independently in various civilizations around 3400 BCE. During this time, humans migrated out of Africa, spread across the globe, and evolved physically and culturally. They developed complex tool-making skills, transitioned from hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled farming communities, and created intricate cave art. Understanding prehistory is challenging due to the lack of written sources, but archaeologists and anthropologists use evidence from artifacts, fossils, and genetic studies to piece together our ancestors' lives and behaviors. This multidisciplinary approach provides valuable insights into the origins and evolution of our species, our ancestors' relationships with their environments, and the development of human culture and society.",13.5,28.74,16.0,15.3,16.19,16.93,6.27,8.5

Prehistory, the vast span of time before recorded history, offers a fascinating glimpse into the dawn of human civilization. This era, often referred to as the Stone Age, is divided into three periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic, or Old Stone Age, spanned from around 3.3 million years ago to about 10,000 BCE, and was characterized by the use of simple stone tools. Homo sapiens, our direct ancestors, emerged around 300,000 years ago during this period. The Mesolithic, or Middle Stone Age, from around 10,000 to 5,000 BCE, saw significant environmental changes as the last ice age ended. This led to the development of more complex tools and the advent of semi-nomadic lifestyles. Finally, the Neolithic, or New Stone Age, from about 5,000 BCE onwards, marked a revolutionary shift",9.0,56.55,11.1,12.0,11.05,11.71,5.02,7.375

Prehistory refers to the period before written records were kept. This span covers a significant portion of human existence, extending from the first appearance of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago until the invention of writing, which varies by civilization. The term 'prehistory' is thus somewhat misleading, as it suggests a time of human history lacking in any form of record, while in reality, it is rich with archaeological and paleontological evidence. This evidence includes artifacts, fossils, and architectural remains that provide insights into the lives of early humans, their cultures, and their interactions with the natural world.

Prehistory, a term coined by French historian Henri Martin in 1869, refers to the span of human history before the advent of written records. It encompasses a vast period, from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing systems, which occurred independently in various civilizations between 3400-3200 BCE. This era is often divided into Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages based on the dominant materials used for tools and weapons. Prehistory is primarily studied through archaeology, anthropology, and paleoanthropology, disciplines that rely on material culture and physical remains to reconstruct human societies. Key sites like Stonehenge in England, Göbekli Tepe in Turkey, and the Lascaux Cave in France provide invaluable insights into prehistoric cultures, their beliefs, and technological advancements.
