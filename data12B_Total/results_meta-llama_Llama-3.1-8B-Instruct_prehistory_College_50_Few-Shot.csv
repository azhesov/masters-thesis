Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war.

It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Prehistory is the time period before written records were kept. Archaeological artifacts provide clues about the lives of prehistoric people. A lack of written records does not mean that people did not have complex societies or cultures. Instead, their stories were passed down through oral tradition.  Prehistory is a silent period in human history. 
In a state of prehistory, the development of written language was not yet established, making the period before history a void of records. The people of that time communicated through oral traditions. Thus, we can only interpret their lives through artifacts. 

Prehistory is the period of human history before written records. Archaeologists piece together lives from artifacts. The lack of written records doesn't indicate simplistic societies. Instead, stories were passed through oral tradition. Prehistory is a silent period.  Without written records, prehistory remains a void of documentation. Oral traditions replaced written language. The lives of prehistoric people can only be interpreted through archaeological findings.

Prehistory is the period of time before written records. The study of prehistory involves uncovering the lives and customs of ancient people through archaeology, anthropology, and other disciplines.
