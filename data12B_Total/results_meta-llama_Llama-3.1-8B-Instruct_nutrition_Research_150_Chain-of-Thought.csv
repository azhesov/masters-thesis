Nutrition refers to the provision, to an organism, of the materials necessary for maintenance of life, including the uptake and processing of nutrients. The intake of nutrients is a complex process that involves multiple physiological and biochemical pathways. Nutrients are vital for energy production, growth, and repair of tissues, as well as the maintenance of optimal physiological function. A well-balanced diet provides the necessary nutrients to support overall health, while an imbalanced diet can lead to various health issues. Factors that influence nutrient intake and utilization include genetics, age, sex, and environmental factors. The human body requires a broad range of nutrients, including carbohydrates, fats, proteins, vitamins, and minerals, which are obtained through the consumption of various food sources. Adequate nutrition is crucial for maintaining optimal health and preventing disease.

The study of nutrition is a multidisciplinary field that encompasses various disciplines including biochemistry, physiology, pharmacology, and microbiology. It involves the analysis of the interplay between nutrients, food, and the human body. Nutritionists examine the biochemical processes that occur within the body to understand how nutrients are absorbed, digested, and utilized. This knowledge enables them to assess the nutritional value of foods and develop strategies to prevent and treat nutritional deficiencies and disorders. The field of nutrition also extends to the study of the impact of diet on human health, including the role of nutrition in the prevention and treatment of chronic diseases such as obesity, diabetes, and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, nutritionists investigate the effects of food processing, food additives, and environmental factors on human nutrition.
