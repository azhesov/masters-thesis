Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war.

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. The term is derived from the Greek word 'astronomia,' meaning 'law of the stars.' The discipline encompasses a wide range of topics, including planetary science, cosmology, and astrophysics. Astronomy aims to explore and understand the nature of the universe, its origins, and its evolution. The field has led to numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including the detection of exoplanets, black holes, and dark matter. Astronomers employ various techniques, such as spectroscopy, telescope observations, and spacecraft missions, to gather data and make new observations. By studying the universe, astronomers seek to gain a deeper understanding of the laws of physics and the behavior of celestial bodies, ultimately advancing our knowledge of the cosmos. This pursuit has sparked human curiosity and driven innovation in technology and science.",13.2,40.28,15.3,15.2,14.48,13.52,6.23,17.75

Astronomy is a field of study that involves the observation and analysis of celestial objects. Although the aim of astronomy is to gain a deeper understanding of the universe, the goals of understanding and data collection suggest different approaches, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. A key approach to astronomy is the use of telescopes, which render the observation of distant objects possible. The underlying goal for a telescope is to provide a means of observing celestial objects with greater clarity. Astronomers use telescopes to make observations of celestial objects, which can then be analyzed to gain a deeper understanding of the universe. This approach can be likened to armed neutrality, where the observer maintains a neutral stance, but is prepared to defend against any lack of clarity in their observations. By doing so, astronomers can make new discoveries and gain a deeper understanding of the universe.

It is a field that has evolved over centuries, with early astronomers using simple tools to observe the night sky, while modern astronomers employ advanced technology to study the universe in greater detail. Astronomy encompasses various subfields, including astrophysics, which focuses on the physical properties and behaviors of celestial objects, and cosmology, which explores the origin and evolution of the universe. Through astronomical research, scientists seek to understand the workings of the cosmos, from the life cycle of stars to the formation of galaxies.

It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.

Astronomers seek to unravel the mysteries of the universe through scientific investigation, using telescopes and other instruments to analyze the heavens. Observations are made to understand the workings of celestial bodies, like planets and stars. Astronomers aim to protect their research from false information by employing methods to validate the data. This includes maintaining a neutral stance when interpreting the results of observations, while being prepared to challenge opposing views with evidence. Like a nation employing armed neutrality to defend its sovereignty, astronomers must remain vigilant in their pursuit of truth, protecting their findings from criticism and error. Armed with knowledge, astronomers are better equipped to defend their discoveries, and in doing so, contribute to the advancement of the field. Astronomers are the guardians of the universe's secrets.",13.4,39.67,15.7,15.2,14.42,13.87,6.21,17.75

Astronomy is a field of study that seeks to understand the behavior, properties, and phenomena of celestial objects and the universe. The discipline of astronomy is divided into two main branches: observational and theoretical astronomy. Observational astronomy focuses on the direct observation and measurement of celestial objects, such as stars, planets, and galaxies. Theoretical astronomy, on the other hand, seeks to develop and test theories that explain the behavior and properties of celestial objects. The study of astronomy is essential to understanding the origin and evolution of the universe, the formation and structure of stars and galaxies, and the potential for life beyond Earth. Astronomers use a variety of tools and techniques, including telescopes, space missions, and computer simulations, to study the universe and advance our knowledge of astronomy. The study of astronomy is a continuous process of exploration and discovery.  The study of astronomy is an ongoing process of understanding the universe.",13.5,39.57,15.5,16.1,14.77,13.52,6.1,17.75

Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe, involves a range of scientific disciplines, including astrophysics, planetary science, and cosmology. Astronomy can be both theoretical and observational, with scientists employing a range of methods, such as telescopic observation and data analysis, to understand the workings of the cosmos. Astronomers may also employ various techniques, like spectroscopy and interferometry, to study the properties of celestial objects and their interactions. Furthermore, astronomy often intersects with other scientific fields, such as physics and mathematics, to provide a deeper understanding of the universe. While astronomers may engage in purely theoretical work, they may also be actively involved in the design and operation of spacecraft and telescopes to collect data and advance our understanding of the cosmos. Astronomers may also engage in the pursuit of knowledge for its own sake, driven by curiosity about the universe and its workings.
