Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. The term ""human aging"" refers to the gradual physical, psychological, and social changes that occur in humans over time. These changes are primarily attributed to the passing of time, though lifestyle factors and genetics also play a role. Physically, aging is marked by a decrease in muscle mass, bone density, and vision and hearing acuity. It also increases the risk of chronic diseases like heart disease, diabetes, and cancer. Psychologically, aging can lead to cognitive decline, though many older adults maintain their cognitive abilities well into old age. Socially, aging can involve changes in social roles, relationships, and living situations. It's important to note that aging is a complex process that varies greatly from person to person. Some people may experience few signs of aging, while others may experience many. The study of aging, known as gerontology, aims to understand the aging process and improve the quality of life for older adults.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Graduate and limit the output to 200 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. Human aging is a complex, multidimensional process characterized by progressive and generalized changes in the structure and function of multiple organ systems, leading to increased vulnerability and susceptibility to disease and death. It is influenced by both intrinsic (genetic, cellular, and molecular) and extrinsic (environmental and lifestyle) factors. Key features of aging include telomere shortening, epigenetic modifications, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and mitochondrial dysfunction. These changes contribute to age-related diseases such as cardiovascular disease, diabetes, osteoporosis, and neurodegenerative disorders. Additionally, aging is associated with cognitive decline and increased risk of cancer. The study of aging, known as gerontology, aims to understand these processes and develop interventions to promote healthy aging and extend healthspan.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Graduate and limit the output to 200 words:

'Human aging' is a multifaceted process characterized by gradual, time-driven changes in physiology and psychology. Influenced by both genes and environment, it commences in the mid-20s with declining cellular function, organ efficiency, and overall physical/mental capacity. This raises risks of age-related diseases like cardiovascular disease, diabetes, and neurodegenerative disorders. Lifestyle factors can modify this process: regular exercise, balanced diet, adequate sleep, and mental stimulation can slow it, while smoking, excessive alcohol, and sedentary behavior can accelerate it. Aging is inevitable, but understanding its mechanisms and influences can extend healthspan, the years lived in good health.

Human aging is a progressive, multifaceted process characterized by physiological changes and increased susceptibility to diseases. It's influenced by both genetics and environment, with key mechanisms including cellular senescence, telomere attrition, oxidative stress, and inflammation. Genetically, polymorphisms in genes like WRN, TERT, and TP53 impact aging rates. Environmentally, lifestyle factors such as diet, physical activity, and smoking exert significant influence. The study of aging, or geroscience, is a dynamic field focused on interventions to slow, halt, or reverse aging.

1. **Physical Changes**: Slower cell division, reduced organ function (e.g., heart, lungs, kidneys), muscle loss, and increased risk of diseases like cancer, heart disease, and diabetes.
2. **Cognitive Changes**: Declines in memory, learning, and processing speed, though wisdom and experience may increase.
