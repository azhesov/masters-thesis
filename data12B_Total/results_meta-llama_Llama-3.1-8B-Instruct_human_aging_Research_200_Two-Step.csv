Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. 
Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process that involves the gradual deterioration of physical and biological systems. It is characterized by a decrease in cellular function, increased oxidative stress, and a decline in the body's ability to repair and replace damaged cells and tissues. The aging process is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including lifestyle choices, diet, and exposure to toxins. As we age, our cells undergo a series of changes, including telomere shortening, epigenetic modifications, and the accumulation of senescent cells. These changes contribute to the development of age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. The aging process also affects the body's ability to adapt to stress and injury, making older adults more susceptible to illness and disability. Understanding the mechanisms of human aging is essential for developing effective interventions to promote healthy aging and prevent age-related diseases. Researchers are exploring various strategies to slow or reverse the aging process, including lifestyle modifications","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Research and limit the output to 200 words:

Human development is the process by which a human being grows and matures from conception to old age. The stages of human development include:

1. **Embryonic Stage (0-8 weeks)**: The fertilized egg undergoes rapid cell division and differentiation, forming a blastocyst and eventually an embryo.
2. **Fetal Stage (8 weeks - birth)**: The embryo develops into a fetus, and major organs and body systems form.
3. **Prenatal Stage (from conception to birth)**: The developing fetus grows and matures in the womb.
4. **Infancy (0-1 year)**: The newborn adapts to the external environment and develops basic motor skills.
5. **Childhood (1-12 years)**: Children learn and develop cognitive, social, and motor skills.
6. **Adolescence (12-20 years)**: Teenagers undergo significant physical and emotional changes as they transition to adulthood.
