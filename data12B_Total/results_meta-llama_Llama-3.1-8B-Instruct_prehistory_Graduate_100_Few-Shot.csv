Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities.

Prehistory (from the Greek prē-historia, ""before history"") is the period of time before written records. Prehistorians study the material remains of past human cultures, such as artifacts, architecture, and other archaeological evidence. The period is divided into several sub-periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Age. Each period is characterized by distinct cultural and technological developments. Prehistory spans from the emergence of the first hominids to the advent of writing, and is a crucial area of study for understanding the origins of human societies and cultures. Its study is interdisciplinary.

Prehistory is the study of human existence before written records. It is a vast field of research that seeks to uncover the lives and cultures of ancient societies through archaeological and anthropological methods. Prehistorians examine the artifacts, tools, and other remnants left behind by our ancestors, often in the absence of written documentation. This field is essential in understanding human evolution, migration patterns, and the development of civilizations, providing valuable insights into the past and its impact on the present. It is a complex and multifaceted discipline, requiring interdisciplinary approaches. Its findings continue to reshape our understanding of human history.  The study of prehistory continues to evolve, incorporating new technologies and methodologies.​

Prehistory (from the Greek pro, ""before"" and historia, ""inquiry"" or ""knowledge"") is the period of time prior to written records, during which human societies developed from their earliest emergence in Africa to the advent of writing. The discipline of prehistory seeks to understand the social, cultural, and economic developments of these societies through the study of archaeological sites, artifacts, and oral traditions. Archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians collaborate in the field of prehistory to reconstruct the lives and experiences of ancient humans. Through their research, prehistorians can shed light on the origins of human societies and the evolution of culture.

Prehistory (from the Greek prefix 'pre', meaning ""before"", and historia, ""history""), is the period of human history before written records. This period spans from the earliest human existence to the invention of writing, typically dated to around 3,500 BCE. Prehistory is studied by archaeologists and anthropologists, who use archaeological sites, artifacts, and other data to reconstruct the lives of early humans. The study of prehistory often overlaps with the study of history, as the early stages of human development are often intertwined with the emergence of writing and the rise of civilizations. Its findings are often relevant to understanding human evolution.  This field of study is concerned with the material culture of ancient human societies, including tools, art, architecture, and burial practices. It seeks to understand the social and cultural dynamics of these early societies, and to illuminate the course of human evolution. The prehistoric period is often divided into several stages, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic",14.8,36.02,17.6,16.6,16.82,13.64,6.83,18.0

The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Example 2:
It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Prehistory (from the Greek πρίν, ""before"" and ἱστορία, ""history"") is the period of time before written records were kept. This period, spanning from the emergence of the first hominids to the invention of writing, is a subject of study within archaeology and anthropology. Prehistory is divided into several distinct periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. These periods are characterized by the development of increasingly complex societies and technologies. The study of prehistory is essential for understanding the evolution of human culture and the development of complex societies. It is a rich and diverse field of study.

Prehistory (from the Greek ""before history""), the period of human history before written records, is a vast and multifaceted field of study. It is the scholarly and scientific investigation of human existence, from the emergence of the first hominids to the advent of written civilizations. Prehistorians use a range of disciplines, including archaeology, anthropology, and paleontology, to reconstruct the lives and cultures of ancient peoples. Despite the lack of written records, prehistorians have been able to piece together a rich and nuanced picture of human history, one that reveals the complexities and diversity of human experience.

Prehistory (from the Greek pre, ""before"" and historia, ""inquiry"" or ""knowledge"") is the study of the past, from the earliest humans to the beginning of written records. The study of prehistory is a combination of archaeology, anthropology, and other disciplines, as the earliest humans did not leave behind written records of their lives. The term ""prehistory"" was coined in 1836 by Christian Jürgensen Thomsen, a Danish archaeologist. The field of prehistory has shed light on human migration, technology, culture, and societal organization during the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic, Bronze, and Iron Ages. 
Prehistory is a branch of history that seeks to understand the lives and activities of humans before the advent of written records. It encompasses various subfields, such as paleoanthropology, archaeology, and ethnoarchaeology, which help reconstruct the lives of our ancient ancestors.

Prehistory, or protohistory, is the period of human history from the emergence of the first hominids to the invention of writing, often considered to be around 5,000 to 10,000 years ago. It is the study of the past through the analysis of material culture, such as tools, artifacts, and other remnants. Prehistory is also known as protohistory, and is distinct from history, which begins with written records. The study of prehistory involves archaeology, anthropology, and the other disciplines, and is concerned with understanding the development of human societies and cultures before the advent of written records. Its scope is vast and complex.
