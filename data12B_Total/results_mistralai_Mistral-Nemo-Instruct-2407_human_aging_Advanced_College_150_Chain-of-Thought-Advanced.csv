2. Use simple vocabulary and short sentences to target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 15.
3. Write the paragraph and calculate its Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level.

Final Paragraph:
Human aging is when our body and mind change over time. As we get older, our skin gets wrinkled, and our hair turns gray. Our bones and muscles may get weaker, making it harder to move around. We might also find it tough to remember things or learn new ones. These changes happen because our cells don't work as well as they used to. They can't fix damage as quickly, and they start to die off. This is why older people often need more help and rest. It's just part of getting older.

Human aging is a natural process that happens over time. It begins in our mid-20s when our bodies start to slow down cell production. This leads to changes like wrinkles, gray hair, and weaker muscles. Our senses also decline, making it harder to see, hear, and taste things. Our organs work less efficiently, too. The heart pumps slower, the lungs hold less air, and the kidneys clean less blood. This makes us more prone to diseases and injuries. But remember, aging is a normal part of life and it's different for everyone.

Human aging is a complex process where our bodies change over time. It starts in our early twenties when cells begin to divide more slowly, and our DNA repairs itself less efficiently. As we age, our body's systems weaken. Muscles lose strength, bones become more fragile, and our immune system struggles to fight off diseases. Our skin wrinkles and turns gray due to less collagen and slower cell renewal. Aging also affects our mind, with memory and thinking skills often declining. Yet, aging isn't all negative. With age, we gain wisdom, experience, and resilience. It's a natural part of life that happens to everyone.",7.5,60.41,8.6,9.2,7.39,10.19,4.51,5.666666666666667

Human aging is the gradual process of change that occurs in a person over time, typically after the age of 20. It involves a decrease in physical capabilities, such as muscle strength and bone density, as well as changes in cognitive functions like memory and reaction time. This process is influenced by both internal factors, like genetics and cellular damage, and external factors, like lifestyle choices and environmental factors. Understanding human aging is crucial for developing strategies to improve quality of life in old age and mitigate age-related diseases.

Our skin wrinkles, muscles lose strength, and bones can become fragile. Inside our body, cells divide slower, and we're more prone to diseases like cancer or heart problems. This is because our cells and DNA accumulate damage over years, and our body's repair systems can't keep up. However, scientists still don't fully understand why we age, and they're working to find ways to slow or stop it.""
