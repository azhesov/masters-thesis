Sure, let's talk about something very important for our bodies: nutrition!

Nutrition is like the food and drinks that give us energy and help us grow. You know how plants need sun, water, and soil to live? We humans need certain foods to stay healthy and strong.

For example, fruits and veggies have vitamins and minerals. Grains give us energy. Proteins help our muscles and bones grow. Dairy products make our bones strong. When we eat a variety of these foods, we're getting the best nutrition.

So, let's eat a colorful plate of food every day! That's how we take care of our bodies.",4.6,78.96,5.9,8.7,6.53,7.51,3.21,4.9
