The term 'prehistory' is commonly used in archaeology to refer to the period before the advent of written records, which varies across different cultures and regions. This era spans from the earliest human-like species to the invention of writing systems, encompassing the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Prehistory is often categorized into three main stages: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. Understanding prehistory is crucial for comprehending the origins and evolution of human societies, cultures, and technologies. Archaeological evidence, such as artifacts, structures, and human remains, provides valuable insights into the lives of our ancestors during this time, allowing us to reconstruct their history and appreciate the foundations of our modern world.

The term 'prehistory' denotes the span of human existence preceding the advent of written records, thus encompassing an extensive temporal framework that predates history. This epoch is characterized by the absence of written communication, necessitating the utilization of archaeological artifacts, oral traditions, and linguistic analyses to deduce information about past societies. Consequently, the study of prehistory is intrinsically intertwined with the disciplines of archaeology, anthropology, and linguistics, which collaborate to illuminate the enigmatic world of our prehistoric ancestors.",13.8,27.93,16.0,15.4,16.11,16.35,6.25,8.571428571428571

Prehistory, a term coined by Scottish historian Daniel Defoe in the 18th century, refers to the vast expanse of time before written records were created. It spans from the dawn of humanity, around 2.6 million years ago, to the advent of written language, which varies by civilization but generally occurred between 3200 BCE and 1200 BCE. This era is crucial for understanding the evolution of human species, the development of early cultures, and the establishment of various civilizations. However, it is also a challenging period to study due to the absence of written accounts. Archaeologists and anthropologists rely on physical evidence such as artifacts, fossils, and architectural remains to piece together this intricate puzzle of our collective past.",11.0,45.96,12.2,13.0,13.15,12.64,5.61,7.857142857142858

In the realm of historical inquiry, the term 'prehistory' denotes the vast expanse of time preceding the advent of written records, a period characterized by the absence of documentary evidence. This era, spanning from the emergence of hominids to the inception of civilizations with written languages, is often delineated by the rise of agriculture and the domestication of animals. Prehistory, therefore, encapsulates the formative stages of human societies, their cultural developments, and technological advancements, all of which laid the groundwork for the complex societies that would follow.",13.1,35.17,15.0,14.1,14.8,14.79,6.3,10.666666666666666
