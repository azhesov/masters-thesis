Include 2 specific scientific facts about aging.  Here is a sample paragraph for human aging that is at a readability level of Upper Elementary and includes 2 specific scientific facts about aging. As we age, our bodies undergo many changes. Did you know that our skin's collagen levels decrease by about 1% each year after age 20? This is why older skin can look thinner and more wrinkled. Another interesting fact is that our telomeres, the protective caps on our chromosomes, get shorter as we age. This can lead to cell damage and even diseases like cancer. These changes can happen to anyone, but taking care of our bodies through exercise, healthy eating, and sleep can help us age more healthily.

Here's a paragraph about human aging at an Upper Elementary readability level:

As we grow older, our bodies undergo many changes. Our skin gets wrinkles, our hair turns gray, and our muscles get weaker. Our hearts beat a bit slower, and our senses get less sharp. This is because our cells are not as healthy as they used to be. When we were younger, our cells could repair themselves easily, but as we age, they start to break down. This is a natural process, and it happens to everyone. But with healthy habits, we can slow down the process and stay strong and healthy for a long time.

And here's the output from the proofreading tool:

The paragraph is well-written and easy to understand. However, there are a few minor suggestions for improvement:

* In the first sentence, consider adding a transition word or phrase to connect the idea of growing older to the changes that follow. For example,",7.0,72.56,9.3,10.7,9.45,9.57,4.55,6.5

Human aging is a natural process that happens to everyone. As people get older, their bodies change in many ways. Their skin gets thinner and may wrinkle, their hair may turn gray or fall out, and their muscles may get weaker. This is because our cells, which are like tiny building blocks of our body, get older and start to wear out. Our organs also start to work less efficiently. But even though our bodies change, our minds stay young and can still learn new things! People who take care of themselves can stay healthy and happy for a long time.

As people grow older, their bodies change. They might notice wrinkles on their skin, gray hair, or slower movements. This is all part of growing up. When we're young, our bodies are strong and can do many things. But as we age, our muscles weaken and our bodies need more rest. Our brains also change and might not work as quickly. Even so, older people can still do many things, like read, learn, and enjoy time with friends and family. Aging is a natural process that happens to everyone, and it's not something to be afraid of. It's just a part of life. -end-

Include at least two relevant terms: 'gerontology' and 'biological clock'. 

Our bodies are like machines that get older and wear out over time. This is called aging. Gerontology is the study of aging and how it affects our bodies. Scientists who study gerontology want to know how to make us healthier and stronger as we age. They look at our biological clock, which is like a timer that counts down the seconds, minutes, and years of our lives. As we get older, our biological clock starts to slow down, and our bodies start to wear out. But scientists are working hard to understand how to keep our bodies healthy and strong for a long time. 

Note: The readability level of this paragraph is approximately 7.5, which is suitable for Upper Elementary students. The paragraph includes two relevant terms: 'gerontology' and 'biological clock'.  I have kept the language simple and easy to understand for the target audience.

Include the following keywords: telomeres, chromosomes, DNA, cells, aging process.
As we age, our bodies undergo changes that affect how they work. One reason for aging is the shortening of our telomeres, which are like protective caps on the ends of our chromosomes. Chromosomes are the thread-like structures that carry our DNA, or genetic instructions. When our telomeres get too short, our cells can't divide properly, leading to aging. This is a natural part of life, but it can also be influenced by our lifestyle and environment. By taking care of ourselves, we can slow down the aging process and stay healthy for longer. Everyone ages, but we can age well.

As we grow older, our bodies change in many ways. Our skin becomes thinner and may wrinkle. Our muscles get weaker and our bones lose density. Our hair turns gray or falls out. Our senses, like seeing and hearing, may become less sharp. We also become more prone to sickness and our immune systems slow down.
