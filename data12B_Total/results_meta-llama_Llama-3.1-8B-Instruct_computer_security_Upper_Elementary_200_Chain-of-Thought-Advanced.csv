Computer security is like doing the same thing with your computer. You make sure the bad guys (hackers) can't get into your computer and take your important stuff like passwords and pictures.

    To keep your computer secure, you need to use strong passwords, be careful when you click on links or download things from the internet, and keep your computer's software up to date. This is like keeping your house clean and tidy, so it's harder for the bad guys to find anything valuable.
