Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. The term 'aging' refers to a complex process of physical, psychological, and social changes that occur as humans grow older. This process begins in the late 20s and continues throughout life, with the rate and pattern of change varying among individuals. Aging is characterized by a decline in physiological functions, such as decreased muscle mass, impaired vision and hearing, and increased risk of chronic diseases like heart disease and diabetes. Psychological changes may include cognitive decline and increased risk of dementia, while social changes can involve reduced social interactions and support networks. However, aging is not merely a process of decline; it also brings wisdom, experience, and perspective. Understanding the complex dynamics of human aging is crucial for developing effective strategies to promote healthy aging and improve the quality of life for older adults.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Graduate and limit the output to 100 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. A summary should include the causes of aging, its effects on the human body, and current research and potential treatments.

Aging is a complex, multifactorial process driven by various causes, including telomere attrition, epigenetic changes, stem cell exhaustion, and the accumulation of cellular damage due to oxidative stress and inflammation. These factors collectively contribute to a progressive decline in physiological function, increasing the risk of age-related diseases and ultimately leading to mortality. Aging affects all organ systems, with common manifestations including wrinkled skin, loss of muscle mass, decreased bone density, and cognitive impairment. Current research focuses on understanding the molecular basis of aging, with potential treatments such as senolytics (drugs targeting senescent cells), metformin, and interventions targeting specific pathways like mTOR and sirtuins showing promise in preclinical models.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Graduate and limit the output to 100 words:

Human aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by progressive functional decline and increased susceptibility to disease. It's influenced by both intrinsic factors (genetic, cellular, molecular) and extrinsic factors (environmental, lifestyle). Key changes include telomere shortening, epigenetic alterations, mitochondrial dysfunction, and accumulation of cellular damage. This leads to declines in tissue and organ function, such as reduced muscle mass, bone density, and cognitive function.
