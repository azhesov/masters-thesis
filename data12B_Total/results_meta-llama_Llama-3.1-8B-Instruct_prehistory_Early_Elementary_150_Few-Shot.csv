Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.

Prehistory is a time in the past before we had written records. People from long ago didn’t write down their stories. We don’t know much about them, but we can learn from the things they left behind. We can see the rocks and bones that they used. We can even see their homes. We can learn from the pictures they made on the walls. These pictures are like stories. We can see what they hunted, what they ate, and how they lived. We can learn about their families and their friends. We can learn about the tools they used to make their lives easier. We can learn about the world they lived in. Prehistory is a time of mystery, but we can still learn a lot about it. We can learn from the clues they left behind. We can learn about people from a long, long time ago.

Long, long ago, there were people who lived before history was written down. These people are called prehistorians. They used tools and made their own food. Prehistorians hunted and gathered food. They lived in caves. Sometimes they made their own houses from sticks and stones. Prehistorians made their own clothes from animal skins and leaves. They had to be very strong and brave. They had to fight off wild animals. Prehistorians were very good at making things. They made their own tools and weapons. They made their own art. Sometimes they made pictures on rocks. We don’t know very much about prehistorians. But we can learn about them from their old things. We can learn about them from their old tools and pictures. We can learn about them from the rocks they made pictures on. We can learn about them from the old houses they built. We can learn about them from the old clothes they made. .

Prehistory started long ago, before people had written words. At that time, people lived in small groups and hunted for food. They made tools from stones, wood, and bones. Some of these tools were good, and some of them were bad. When a tool was good, people used it to help them. When a tool was bad, people did not use it. People also made shelters. These were homes made from sticks and animal hides. People needed to be safe from the cold and the rain. Some people made fires to keep warm and to cook their food. People also made clothes from animal hides and feathers. They needed to keep warm and to stay safe. People lived in small groups, and they helped each other. They shared food and tools. They worked together.

Prehistory was a time before humans wrote things down. There were no books, no papers, and no computers. It is hard to know what happened a long time ago. We can learn about prehistory from things that were left behind. There were stones, bones, and other things that people made and used. Some people made tools from stones. They used the tools to hunt for food. Other people made houses from sticks and mud. They lived in the houses with their families. We can also learn about prehistory from pictures that were painted on walls. The pictures show us what people looked like and what they did. It is like reading a story, but it is a story told with pictures. People who lived in prehistory were very resourceful. They made the most of what they had. We can learn a lot from them.

A long time ago, before our time, there were people who lived. They lived before our history began. This time is called prehistory. They lived in small groups, in caves, or in houses made of sticks and mud. They hunted animals for food, and they grew plants in the ground. They used stones to make tools, like knives and spears. They used sticks to make bows and arrows. They made fire to keep warm and to cook their food. They lived in a world that was very different from the world we live in today. They didn’t have cars, or computers, or houses made of bricks. They lived in a world that was very hard to live in. But they were clever and strong. They made the best of the world they lived in. They are the people who came before us. They are the people who helped us become who we are today.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. 

Prehistory is the time before history. It is when our ancestors lived. They didn’t have books to write about their lives. So, we don’t know much about it. We can guess about it. We can look at the rocks, bones, and tools we find. These things help us understand what our ancestors did. Some people think that our ancestors lived in caves. Others think they lived in tents. We can guess that they hunted animals for food. We can also guess that they made tools from rocks and sticks. We can learn more about prehistory by looking at the things that our ancestors left behind. But we can never really know for sure. It’s like finding an egg in the grass. We can ask the birds and animals if it’s theirs, but they might not know. We can guess, but we can never be sure.  ​

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. 
Prehistory is a time when there was no written language. There were no books or papers. People just told each other stories. They passed down the stories from one generation to the next. People lived in small groups. They hunted animals for food. They made their own tools from rocks and sticks. They built homes from branches and leaves. There were no cities, just small villages. There were no cars or trains, just people on foot. They traveled long distances on foot. The weather was cold. They had to be careful to stay warm. They had to be careful to find food. People were very strong and brave. They had to be. They had to survive. They didn’t have any tools to help them. They just had to rely on themselves.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. The Sun’s light shines on Earth. Our world is old. Before we were here, other people lived. That was a long time ago. It was before our history books. That time is called prehistory. People didn’t write down their stories back then. But we can still learn about them. We can look at pictures and tools they made. We can dig in the ground and find things they left behind. We can use that to learn about their lives. That way, we can know more about prehistory. People in prehistory hunted for food and built homes. They made tools and clothes. They were people just like us, but they lived a long time ago. They had their own stories and ways of life. Prehistory is a time of mystery and adventure.
