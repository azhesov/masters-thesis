The 'Paleolithic' period is the earliest stage of human development. It began approximately 6 million years ago and ended around 10,000 years ago. During this period, early humans developed from a single species, Homo habilis, to more advanced forms like Homo erectus. They created simple tools, such as stone knives and scrapers. Early humans also used fire for warmth and cooking. They lived in small groups, probably nomadic. The 'Mesolithic' period is the second stage of human development. It started around 10,000 years ago and lasted until 5,000 years ago. During this period, humans developed more complex tools, such as bows and arrows. They also created more complex societies, such as small villages. The 'Neolithic' period is the third and final stage of human development. It began around 5,000 years ago and lasted until 3,000 years ago. During this period, humans developed more advanced tools, such as the wheel and the plow. They also created more complex societies, such as large cities. People developed agriculture, domesticated animals, and created written languages. They also created more complex spiritual practices, such as worshipping gods and goddesses.

Prehistory is a time period in human history that happened before people could write. It's divided into three main parts: the Stone Age, the Middle Ages, and the New Stone Age. During this time, people made tools, created societies, and developed cultures that helped form the societies we have today. Archaeologists dig up old sites and study artifacts to learn about the people who lived a long time ago. By studying prehistory, we can understand how humans evolved, how societies developed, and where we come from. It's like solving a puzzle to learn about our ancestors.

Here's a 100-word summary of prehistory:

Prehistory is the time before written records were kept. It's the story of early humans and how they lived. The earliest humans used stones to make tools and hunt for food. As time went on, humans got smarter and made better tools. They discovered fire, grew food, and domesticated animals. This helped them create complex societies. There were three main eras: the Old Stone Age, the Middle Stone Age, and the New Stone Age. Each era had new discoveries and advancements that led to the development of civilizations. Prehistory paved the way for the world we live in today.  #prehistory #humanhistory #earlyhumans #tools #technology #societies #paleolithicera #mesolithicera #neolithicera #agriculture #domestication #civilizations #humanculture #history #anthropology #archaeology
