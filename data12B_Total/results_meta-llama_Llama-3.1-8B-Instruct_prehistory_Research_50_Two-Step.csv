### Explanation

Prehistory is the time period before written records, and it is considered the earliest phase of human history. It spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. During this period, humans developed tools, languages, and societies in the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods.

The Paleolithic period, also known as the Old Stone Age, is characterized by the use of stone tools and the development of early human societies. The Mesolithic period, also known as the Middle Stone Age, is marked by the development of more advanced stone tools and the emergence of complex societies. The Neolithic period, also known as the New Stone Age, is characterized by the development of agriculture and the emergence of settled societies.

Archaeological evidence, such as artifacts and fossils, and oral traditions, such as myths and legends, provide our understanding of prehistoric cultures. These sources allow us to reconstruct the lives and experiences of our ancestors, and to understand the development of human societies over time.
