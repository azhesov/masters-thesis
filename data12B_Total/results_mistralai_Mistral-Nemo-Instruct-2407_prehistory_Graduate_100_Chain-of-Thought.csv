Prehistory refers to the vast expanse of human history prior to written records. This period encompasses the emergence and evolution of Homo sapiens, as well as their ancestors and contemporary hominids, across various geographic regions. Prehistory is characterized by the absence of direct historical documentation, necessitating the use of archaeological, anthropological, and paleoenvironmental evidence to reconstruct human activities, cultural practices, and technological advancements. The study of prehistory offers invaluable insights into the origins and development of human societies, their interactions with the natural world, and the complex processes that have shaped our collective past.",13.8,28.03,15.2,15.2,16.37,15.6,6.52,8.714285714285714

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. Here is my plan: Prehistory is the time before written records began. It is a broad term that encompasses a vast period of human history from the first emergence of our species to the advent of writing.

Prehistory, a term coined by French historian Henri Martin in 1866, refers to the expansive epoch preceding the advent of written records. This period, commencing with the first emergence of Homo sapiens and concluding with the inception of writing, spans a colossal swath of human history, marked by significant milestones such as the development of tool use, the control of fire, and the migration of early humans across continents. The study of prehistory relies heavily on archaeological evidence, as it is the only tangible record of this era. This evidence, ranging from artifacts to architectural structures, provides invaluable insights into the lives, cultures, and technological advancements of our ancestors, allowing us to piece together a narrative of humanity's earliest chapters.",12.8,41.4,14.3,14.9,14.98,12.71,6.18,8.142857142857142

Prehistory, a term often misunderstood, is not merely the absence of written records but a critical era in human history that predates such records. It encompasses the entirety of human existence before the advent of literacy, spanning from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the advent of writing systems, which varied across cultures and occurred as late as the 19th century in some societies. This period is not a void in our understanding of human past but a rich tapestry woven with archaeological findings, linguistic evidence, and genetic studies. Prehistory, therefore, is not a deficit in our historical knowledge but a distinct phase of human development that demands unique methods of investigation and interpretation.",12.7,41.6,14.2,13.8,14.12,12.76,6.31,10.666666666666666

Prehistory, the era before recorded history, is a fascinating yet enigmatic period that predates written records. It spans from the origins of Homo sapiens to the advent of writing, approximately 3.3 million years ago to around 3200 BCE. This epoch is typically divided into three phases: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, each characterized by the dominant materials used for tool-making. Archaeologists, anthropologists, and paleoanthropologists reconstruct this era by analyzing artifacts, fossils, and environmental data. They piece together human evolution, migration patterns, and societal developments, providing invaluable insights into our collective past. However, due to the lack of direct historical sources, our understanding of prehistory is inevitably incomplete and subject to ongoing revision as new discoveries are made.",11.3,39.94,13.1,13.7,13.85,14.55,5.61,6.111111111111111

""Imagine the dawn of humanity, before the written word, when our ancestors left only material traces of their existence. This enigmatic epoch, spanning from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing around 3200 BCE, is known as prehistory. It encompasses the Stone Age, characterized by stone tools, and the Bronze and Iron Ages, marked by metalworking. Understanding this period, often shrouded in mystery, is crucial for unraveling our species' evolutionary journey and cultural development. Archaeologists, anthropologists, and paleoanthropologists painstakingly piece together this puzzle using artifacts, fossils, and environmental evidence, illuminating the lives of our ancient forebears.""",10.7,46.78,13.4,12.9,13.4,14.15,5.57,7.571428571428571
