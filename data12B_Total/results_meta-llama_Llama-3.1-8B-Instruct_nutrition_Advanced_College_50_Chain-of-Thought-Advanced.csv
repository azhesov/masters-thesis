Here's the final answer:

Nutrition is the process by which an organism takes in and uses food for energy, growth, and repair. It involves the breakdown of complex molecules into simpler ones that the body can absorb. This process requires adequate intake of essential nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Nutrition is crucial for maintaining overall health and preventing diseases. It plays a vital role in the functioning of the body's systems, including the nervous, circulatory, and digestive systems. Proper nutrition helps to boost energy levels, support immune function, and promote healthy weight management. By consuming a balanced diet that includes a variety of whole foods, individuals can support optimal nutrition and well-being. 

The final answer is:
