**Final Output:**

Prehistory is the time before written records. It's when our ancestors lived as hunters and gatherers. They didn't have cities or governments. Instead, they moved around looking for food. This was thousands of years before the first civilizations. We learn about this time by studying fossils, art, and tools they left behind. It's like piecing together a puzzle with very old pieces.",5.8,70.39,8.1,8.8,7.16,9.6,3.75,5.1

Here's the plan and the final paragraph:

**Plan:**
1. Define 'prehistory'.
2. Explain the timeline (before written records).
3. Mention human activities and discoveries.
4. Use simple sentence structures and common words.

**Final Paragraph:**
""Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down. This period stretches back to the very start of human life on Earth, about 6 million years ago. During prehistory, people didn't have books or newspapers to record their history. Instead, they left behind clues like tools, art, and buildings. These clues help us understand what life was like before written records.""
