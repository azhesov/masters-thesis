Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Aging is a multifaceted process that involves physical, psychological, and biological changes. As we age, our cells and tissues deteriorate, leading to a decline in physical function and an increased risk of age-related diseases such as Alzheimer's, cancer, and cardiovascular disease. Aging also affects our mental health, with many older adults experiencing depression, anxiety, and cognitive decline. At the cellular level, aging is characterized by telomere shortening, epigenetic changes, and the accumulation of oxidative damage. These changes contribute to the loss of cellular function and the development of age-related diseases. Understanding the biological mechanisms of aging can help us develop new therapeutic strategies to promote healthy aging and prevent age-related diseases.

As we age, our bodies undergo many changes that affect our physical and mental health. Our cells and tissues deteriorate, making it harder to move and increasing the risk of serious diseases like Alzheimer's, cancer, and heart problems. Many older adults experience sadness, anxiety, and memory loss. At a microscopic level, aging is caused by tiny changes in our cells that make them less able to function properly. These changes can lead to age-related diseases. Studying aging can help us find new ways to stay healthy and prevent these diseases. This knowledge can also help create policies and programs that support older adults. Understanding aging is a big and complicated topic that requires a team effort to address.

Aging is a process that happens to all living things, including humans. As people get older, their bodies change in many ways. They may get weaker, their organs may not work as well, and they may be more likely to get sick. This is because our bodies are made up of tiny things called cells, and as we age, these cells start to break down. Many things can affect how quickly or slowly people age, such as what they eat, how much they exercise, and whether they smoke. Even things like pollution and stress can make us age faster. Understanding why and how we age is important so that we can stay healthy as we get older.

Telomeres, the protective caps on chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, contributing to the aging process. Epigenetic changes, such as DNA methylation and histone modifications, also occur, affecting gene expression and influencing aging. Lifestyle factors, including diet, exercise, and stress, can impact aging rates. Inflammaging, a chronic low-grade inflammatory state, is another contributor to aging.
