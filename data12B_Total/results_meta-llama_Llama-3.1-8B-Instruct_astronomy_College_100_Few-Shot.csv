Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war.

Astronomy is the science of studying celestial bodies and the physical universe. Astronomers observe and analyze various objects and phenomena in the universe, such as stars, galaxies, and black holes. Astronomy is a multifaceted field that encompasses various subfields, including astrophysics, cosmology, and planetary science. Astronomers employ a range of techniques, including spectroscopy, photometry, and interferometry, to study the universe. The ultimate goal of astronomy is to understand the origin, evolution, and structure of the universe, and to answer fundamental questions about the cosmos. Astronomers strive to advance our understanding of the universe.

It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.

The study of the universe is called astronomy. Astronomers seek to understand the mysteries of the cosmos. This field of science involves the observation of celestial objects and events, as well as the analysis of data collected from space missions. By studying the universe, astronomers can gain insights into the origins and evolution of the cosmos. To pursue this field, one must have a strong background in mathematics and physics. The use of advanced technologies such as telescopes and computers also plays a significant role in astronomy research. Astronomy seeks to answer the ultimate question of existence: what is the universe.  (100 words)

The term 'astronomy' has a broad meaning and encompasses the study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe. There are two main branches of astronomy, astrophysics and planetary science. Astrophysics is the study of the physical nature of celestial objects and their interactions with each other, while planetary science is the study of the formation and evolution of planets. The study of astronomy involves the use of various techniques and methods such as observations, simulations, and experiments to gain a deeper understanding of the universe. Astronomers use these techniques to advance their knowledge of the cosmos.  The field of astronomy continues to evolve with new discoveries and technologies.  Astronomers strive to understand the universe and its mysteries.  The study of astronomy provides valuable insights into the workings of the universe.
