Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by progressive physiological and functional decline, increasing susceptibility to diseases, and ultimately, death. It is influenced by both intrinsic (genetic, cellular, and molecular) and extrinsic (environmental and lifestyle) factors. Key theories explaining aging include the free radical theory, telomere theory, and epigenetic theory. Interventions such as caloric restriction, exercise, and certain drugs (e.g., rapamycin) have shown promise in extending lifespan and healthspan in various organisms, but human research is still in its early stages.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Upper Elementary and limit the output to 100 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by progressive physiological and biological changes, ultimately leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and death. Key hallmarks include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. These processes interact and reinforce each other, driving age-related pathologies such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Despite its complexity, understanding human aging is crucial for developing targeted interventions to improve healthspan and lifespan.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Upper Elementary and limit the output to 100 words:
