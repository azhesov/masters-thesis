Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

Computer security is the protection of computer systems from theft or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data, as well as from disruption or misdirection of the services they provide. The key to computer security is the secure handling of security measures. This involves proper authentication, authorization, and encryption. It also involves the use of firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and antivirus software. These measures ensure that data remains confidential and secure. They also prevent unauthorized access to computer systems. By using computer security measures, organizations can protect their data and systems from cyber threats. This protects their business and reputation. They can also ensure compliance with regulations. They can also prevent financial loss and legal liability. This is particularly important in today's digital world. Computer security is an ongoing process that requires constant vigilance and monitoring.

Computer security is the process of safeguarding a computer system from unauthorized access and malicious activities. It involves firewalls, encryption, authentication, and secure coding practices to protect against cyber threats and prevent data breaches. The goal is to ensure confidentiality, integrity, and availability of digital assets. It requires ongoing vigilance.",14.5,36.83,17.5,16.8,17.44,14.1,7.28,19.25

Computer security is the process of protecting information from unauthorized access, theft, or damage. It encompasses various aspects, including encryption, access control, and threat detection. Effective security measures prevent data breaches, ensure confidentiality, and maintain the integrity of systems. This critical component is indispensable for today’s interconnected world.  A good security system requires periodic updates to remain effective.
