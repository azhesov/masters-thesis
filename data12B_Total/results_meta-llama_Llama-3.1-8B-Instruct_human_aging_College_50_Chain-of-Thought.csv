Cellular processes, such as DNA repair and telomere shortening, decline, leading to increased susceptibility to disease and mortality. Lifestyle factors, genetics, and environmental influences also play a role.

Step 4: Add more detail to your paragraph.
Human aging is a complex process influenced by genetic and environmental factors. Biological systems undergo a series of changes, including cellular senescence, telomere shortening, and epigenetic modifications. These alterations can lead to decreased cellular function, increased disease susceptibility, and ultimately, death. Cellular senescence, for instance, occurs when cells are damaged beyond repair, leading to a permanent halt in cell division. Telomere shortening, a natural process that occurs with each cell division, can trigger cellular aging. Epigenetic modifications, which affect gene expression without altering DNA sequences, can also contribute to aging by silencing genes essential for cellular health.",12.3,31.89,14.7,13.8,10.65,16.81,5.13,6.888888888888889
