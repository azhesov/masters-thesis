Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Computer security, also known as cybersecurity, involves protecting digital assets from unauthorized access, damage, or disruption. Just as protective tariffs safeguard domestic industries, computer security safeguards data and systems. It ensures that only authorized users can access sensitive information and that systems function as intended. Like a tariff, computer security acts as a barrier, making it more costly and challenging for unauthorized users, such as hackers, to gain access. Effective computer security employs a combination of measures, including encryption, firewalls, and regular software updates, to maintain a state of armed neutrality, ready to counter any cyber threats while preserving the integrity and confidentiality of digital assets.",14.0,38.25,16.6,16.4,15.32,13.99,6.47,17.75

Computer security, or cybersecurity, is the protection of computer systems and networks from digital threats. A computer security system is designed to protect data from unauthorized access, use, disruption, or destruction. It includes measures to control physical access to systems, detect and respond to threats, and recover data after a breach. Effective computer security balances the need for protection with the need for functionality, ensuring that systems are secure but also usable. This is a tradeoff, as stronger security often means more inconvenience for users.",13.5,39.47,15.4,15.5,14.35,13.29,6.19,17.75

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

A computer security policy, in information technology, is the set of laws, procedures, and guidelines that regulate how an organization protects its computer systems and networks. This policy is designed to safeguard the integrity, confidentiality, and availability of information. Computer security policy is a critical aspect of information security, aiming to prevent and mitigate cyber threats. It encompasses various measures, such as access controls, encryption, and regular software updates, to ensure that only authorized individuals can access and use the organization's systems. The goal is to protect the organization's data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This involves maintaining a secure environment that can quickly recover from cyber attacks.",14.8,30.8,16.2,16.3,15.38,14.05,6.48,17.75

A firewall is a computer security system that monitors and controls incoming and outgoing network traffic based on predetermined security rules. Firewalls establish a barrier between a trusted network and untrusted network, such as the Internet. Firewalls are often used to prevent unauthorized Internet users from accessing private networks connected to the Internet, to block malicious software from entering, and to establish a secure environment for all users in the network.",14.3,37.34,16.3,16.2,15.66,13.29,6.57,17.75
