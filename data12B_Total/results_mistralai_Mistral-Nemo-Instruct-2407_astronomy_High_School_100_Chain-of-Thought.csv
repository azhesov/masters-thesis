Astronomy, the study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere, is a fascinating field of science. It involves the observation and analysis of stars, planets, galaxies, and other cosmic bodies. Astronomers, who study these celestial objects, use powerful telescopes to gather data. This data helps them understand the universe's origins, its evolution, and its ultimate fate. Astronomy also plays a crucial role in space exploration, providing insights into potential habitable planets and understanding the conditions required for life to exist.",10.3,47.79,12.1,12.5,11.87,12.93,5.25,8.142857142857142

Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial bodies and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It involves observing stars, planets, galaxies, and other objects in space, as well as understanding their physical and chemical properties. Telescopes are essential tools in astronomy, allowing scientists to collect data from distant places in our universe. By analyzing this information, astronomers can make discoveries about the origins of our solar system, the life cycle of stars, and even the fate of the universe itself. One famous astronomer, Galileo Galilei, revolutionized the field with his invention of the telescope and support for the heliocentric model, which states that the Earth revolves around the Sun.",10.0,54.12,12.8,12.8,13.07,13.11,5.82,7.875
