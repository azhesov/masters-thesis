Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war.

Nutrition is the process of taking in and using food to sustain life and growth. Nutritional tariffs are taxes that make the cost of imported food higher than the cost of domestically produced food. The goal of these tariffs is to protect domestic agriculture. However, they also aim to raise government revenue and encourage healthy eating by making nutritious foods more affordable. Although these goals suggest different tariff rates, a balance between protection and public health promotion is crucial.",12.2,48.33,14.8,14.9,13.69,12.89,5.86,17.75

Nutrition is the process of obtaining and using food for growth, maintenance, and repair of the body. Adequate nutrition is essential for overall health and development. Nutritional needs vary among individuals, based on age, sex, activity level, and health status. For example, an active teenager may require more calories than a sedentary adult. Malnutrition, which can result from insufficient or imbalanced intake, can lead to health problems such as stunted growth, weakened immune system, and even death. Therefore, it is crucial to consume a balanced diet, which includes a variety of foods from all food groups, to meet nutritional needs.",12.1,48.43,14.9,14.8,13.8,12.89,6.14,17.75

Nutritional tariffs are taxes levied on imported food items with the goal of promoting domestic agriculture. These tariffs make foreign foods costlier than their domestic counterparts, fostering a preference for locally grown produce. The primary objective is to support and safeguard the domestic farming industry from international competition. While such tariffs can also generate government revenue, the primary aim is to bolster the agricultural sector by encouraging domestic consumption of locally grown foods. This is achieved by increasing the relative cost of imported food items, thereby promoting a more balanced and self-sustaining food system.",13.7,38.96,15.8,16.0,14.64,13.7,6.13,17.75

Nutritional neutrality is the state of consuming a balanced diet without favoring or restricting specific food groups. It's the policy of maintaining overall health by not excessively relying on one nutrient or another. This may include: Regular intake of all macronutrients—carbohydrates, proteins, and fats—and micronutrients—vitamins and minerals. A balanced diet ensures that one doesn't overindulge in sugars, fats, or proteins, thereby avoiding potential health issues. It's about consuming a variety of foods to meet nutritional needs, rather than adhering to restrictive diets that may lead to deficiencies. Nutritional neutrality is about moderation and balance, similar to armed neutrality, where a state is prepared to defend itself against threats from any direction, but doesn't actively engage in conflict.",13.7,39.06,16.0,15.8,14.96,13.76,6.3,17.75

Nutrition, a crucial factor in human health, involves consuming the right balance of food to maintain growth, development, and overall well-being. Optimal nutrition entails consuming adequate amounts of macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, along with micronutrients such as vitamins and minerals. A balanced diet should include a variety of foods to ensure the intake of all necessary nutrients. Just as protective tariffs aim to shield domestic industries from foreign competition, proper nutrition safeguards our bodies from various health issues by providing the essential building blocks for our cells and organs. Similar to how armed neutrality involves preparedness without commitment, nutrition ensures our bodies are ready to function optimally without overburdening them with excessive or inadequate nutrients.",14.2,37.74,16.9,16.4,15.39,14.05,6.5,17.75

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Nutrition, in the context of health, refers to the process of consuming food for growth and sustenance. A balanced diet, which includes a variety of foods from different food groups, ensures the body receives all necessary nutrients. Essential nutrients, like vitamins and minerals, are crucial for maintaining optimal health. A well-balanced diet also promotes proper growth and development in children. However, excessive consumption of certain nutrients, such as fat and sodium, can lead to health issues. Therefore, moderation is key in maintaining a healthy diet.",13.0,40.79,14.6,15.1,13.94,12.82,5.98,17.75

Optimal nutrition is the intake of food that promotes health and well-being. It involves consuming a balanced diet, ensuring adequate amounts of macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, and fats) and micronutrients (vitamins and minerals). Optimal nutrition is not just about eating enough, but also about eating the right kinds of foods. It's not merely a matter of quantity, but quality. A well-balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, lean proteins, and whole grains, fosters growth, maintains health, and reduces the risk of chronic diseases. Just as a protective tariff aims to safeguard domestic industry, optimal nutrition aims to protect and promote our overall health.",13.4,39.87,15.2,15.2,13.92,13.18,6.08,17.75
