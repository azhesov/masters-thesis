Astronomy, from the Greek words 'astron' (star) and 'nomos' (law), is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It is a natural science that uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry to explain the universe's origin, evolution, and structure. Astronomy involves observing, measuring, and analyzing light from stars, galaxies, and other celestial bodies to understand their properties and behaviors. This branch of science helps us comprehend our place in the cosmos and unravel the mysteries of the universe.
