Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other.

The study of nutrition, or the science of nutrients and their interaction with living organisms, is known as nutrition science. This field encompasses the analysis of how nutrients influence growth, maintenance, and reproduction. As a scientific discipline, nutrition is concerned with the health benefits of different diets, the biochemistry of nutrients, and the diseases that arise from malnutrition. Nutrition is a multidisciplinary field drawing on principles from biochemistry, physiology, psychology, and sociology. The study of nutrition also examines the environmental and cultural factors that affect eating habits and the consequences of dietary choices. Various professionals, including dietitians, researchers, and public health officials, contribute to this field.​
The term nutrition was first coined in 1902 by the German agricultural chemist Carl von Fehling, and in 1929 it was adopted as the title of a learned society in the United States.​

Nutrition is the study of the relationship between food and the body. It is a scientific discipline that examines the nutritional requirements of the body and how they are met through the consumption of foods. Nutritionists consider the interactions between diet, environment, and genetics to understand the impact of nutrition on health. The field of nutrition encompasses the study of the biochemical and physiological processes that occur within the body as a result of nutrient intake, as well as the social and cultural factors that influence eating behaviors.

The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

The concept of nutrition is a multifaceted field that has evolved over time, encompassing various disciplines such as biochemistry, physiology, and food science. The study of nutrition seeks to understand the intricate relationships between diet, health, and disease, as well as the impact of nutrition on human physiology and overall well-being. As a result, theories in nutrition often involve both empirical and theoretical propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that cannot be tested through experimentation alone. Furthermore, nutritional research is an interdisciplinary field, drawing from the knowledge of experts in diverse fields, including biology, chemistry, and medicine.

Nutrition is the scholarly study of food and its role in human health, encompassing biochemistry, physiology, and molecular biology. The term nutrition was first used in English in 1551 by William Bulletin in a treatise on nutrition and health. Scientific nutrition is a multidisciplinary field that seeks to understand the impact of dietary choices on health, disease prevention, and overall well-being. Practitioners of nutrition include dietitians, nutritionists, and biochemists, who investigate the biochemical processes by which nutrients are absorbed, digested, and utilized by the body. Theories in nutrition may involve both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and depend on assumptions that can not be tested.  The study of nutrition has a wide range of applications in public health, agriculture, and food science. It is a rapidly evolving field that continues to reveal new insights into the complex relationships between diet, health, and disease.  Its findings have far-reaching implications for human health, food production",14.7,36.32,17.6,16.4,16.39,13.93,6.82,18.0

Nutrition is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures, and dynamics of food and diet in relation to living organisms. Physical nutrition is the study of the chemical, physiological, and biological processes that occur in the body in response to the consumption of food. The term nutrition was first used in English in 1719 in Thomas Tryon's 'The Way to Health', and has since been extensively studied by scientists and philosophers alike. Theories in physical nutrition may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.
