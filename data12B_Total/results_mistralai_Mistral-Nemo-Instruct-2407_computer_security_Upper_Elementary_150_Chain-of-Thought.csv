**Title: Keeping Your Computer Safe**

Computer security is like having a secret password to protect your toys. Imagine you have a box of your favorite toys. You don't want anyone else to play with them without your permission, right? So, you create a secret password to keep them safe. This is what computer security does for your computer. It protects your computer and the information inside it from bad guys who want to cause harm or steal your personal details.

To keep your computer safe, you need to create strong passwords, just like the one you used for your toy box. A strong password is like a long, mixed-up word that only you know. It's not something simple like '1234' or your name. Also, never share",6.7,67.96,7.3,9.6,7.32,8.56,3.66,6.111111111111111
