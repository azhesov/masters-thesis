Final output: ""Prehistory is the time before recorded history. It spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. This period covers over 99% of human existence. People during prehistory communicated through art, tools, and rituals, rather than written language. Archaeologists study prehistory by examining these artifacts and their context. They help us understand how early humans lived and evolved.""

Prehistory, a term derived from Greek words 'before' and 'history', refers to the period of human existence before written records. This era spans from the first emergence of hominids around 6 million years ago to the invention of writing systems, which varies by culture but generally occurred between 3000 to 1000 BCE. During this time, humans primarily relied on oral traditions to pass down knowledge and used stone tools for survival. Prehistory is often divided into distinct periods based on significant changes in human culture and technology, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. However, it's important to note that the transition between these periods was gradual and not sudden. Our understanding of prehistory comes from archaeological findings, including artifacts, fossils, and architectural remains, which provide valuable insights into the lives of our ancestors.

Prehistory is a vast period of time that spans from the dawn of human existence until the invention of writing, around 3,000 years ago. It's divided into three main eras: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Each era is defined by the dominant materials used for tools and weapons. During prehistory, humans migrated across the globe, adapting to diverse environments and developing complex cultures. However, because writing hadn't been invented yet, we rely on archaeology and anthropology to understand this era. These disciplines study physical remains and cultural practices, providing valuable insights into our ancient ancestors' lives.",9.3,50.43,10.7,11.4,10.48,12.11,4.82,5.888888888888889

**Prehistory** is the time period before written records were kept, starting from the beginning of human existence and ending around 3500 BC. It is divided into three main stages: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. During the Stone Age, humans used stones for tools and weapons. The Bronze Age saw the development of metalworking, while the Iron Age brought significant advancements in agriculture and warfare. Prehistoric humans lived as hunter-gatherers or in small communities, with basic social structures and no formal governments. They developed art, music, and religion, leaving behind evidence of their cultures through archaeological discoveries.
