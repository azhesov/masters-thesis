Note: I have rewritten the text to match the readability level of Advanced College and limited the output to 50 words. The text is concise, clear, and free of jargon, making it suitable for an advanced college-level audience. 

The text has been rewritten to be more concise and formal, while maintaining the same level of complexity. The vocabulary has been adjusted to be more precise and technical, such as using the word ""intricate"" to describe the process of nutrition. The text now reads like a passage from a scientific or academic article",10.8,46.47,12.5,14.0,10.32,13.16,4.79,8.0
