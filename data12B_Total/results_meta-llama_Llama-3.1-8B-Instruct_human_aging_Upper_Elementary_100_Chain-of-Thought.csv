We may lose some of our hair. Some people's teeth start to fall out. Our bodies start to have a harder time fixing themselves when we get sick or hurt. We may need to take medicine or go to the doctor more often.

Here's a paragraph about human aging:
As we get older, our bodies change. When we're kids, we grow and get taller. But as we get older, our bones stop growing, and our bodies start to get smaller. Our muscles also get weaker. Our skin gets wrinkles and starts to sag. Our hair turns gray or white. Our teeth might even fall out! But even though our bodies change, our minds stay sharp. We can still learn new things, read, and have fun with our friends and family. Aging is a natural part of life.

Step 5: Edit and revise the paragraph as needed.

Here is the paragraph: 
As we age, our bodies change. Our muscles get weaker, and our bones get smaller. Our skin gets wrinkles and age spots. Our hair turns gray or white. Our heart beats a little slower. Our senses, like our eyes and ears, get less sharp. Even our brain gets a little slower at thinking and remembering things. But, aging can be healthy or unhealthy. We can take care of our bodies to stay healthy and strong. Exercise, eating healthy food, and getting enough sleep can help us age well.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'human aging' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level.
To explain 'human aging' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level, I need to use simple vocabulary and concepts that they can understand. I'll focus on the basic ideas of how our bodies change as we get older, without getting too technical or complicated.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
I'll use words and phrases that are easy to understand, such as ""growing older,"" ""getting stronger,"" ""losing energy,"" and ""wearing out."" I'll also use simple sentence structures, like declarative sentences, to make it easy for them to follow along.

Here's my attempt at following these steps:

**Step 1 & 2:** To explain human aging to an Upper Elementary reader, I'll use vocabulary like 'older' and 'older bodies' to make it relatable. I'll also use short sentences and active voice.

**Step 3:**
As people get older, their bodies change. They get taller, but then they stop growing. Their muscles get stronger, but then they start to weaken. Older bodies need more rest and less exercise. They can't run as fast or jump as high as younger bodies. This is a natural part of growing up. It's like how plants get older and their leaves start to fall off.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'human aging' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level.
To explain 'human aging' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level, I would start by explaining what aging is and then provide some basic information about how it happens. I would use simple vocabulary and short sentences to make it easy to understand.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For the Upper Elementary level, I would choose vocabulary that is familiar to them, such as ""growing older,"" ""cells,"" and ""hormones."" I would use short, simple sentences that are easy to follow.

Human aging is a natural process that happens to all living things. As people get older, their bodies change. Children grow taller and stronger. Then, as adults, their growth slows down, and their bodies start to get weaker. Older adults may have gray hair, wrinkles, and aches in their bones. Their hearts may beat more slowly. It's like a car that needs to be maintained. If people take care of their bodies, it can run smoothly for a long time. But, just like a car that's been driven for years, it will eventually wear out.

Step 4: Revise your paragraph if necessary.
I don't think I need to revise anything in this paragraph. It's concise and easy to understand. I used simple vocabulary and sentence structure to explain human aging to an upper elementary level reader. I also used a relatable comparison to help them understand the process.

As humans get older, their bodies change in many ways. This process is called aging. When we are young, our skin is smooth and tight, but as we age, it becomes wrinkled and loose. Our hair might turn gray or white, and our muscles get weaker. Older people might need to use glasses or hearing aids because their eyes and ears don't work as well as they used to. Aging is a natural part of life, and it happens to all living things, not just humans. It's a sign that we've lived a long time and experienced many things.

Step 4: Read over your paragraph and make sure it is clear and easy to understand.
Step 5: Check your paragraph for errors in spelling, grammar, and punctuation.
Step 6: Revise your paragraph if needed.

As people get older, they grow older. This is called human aging. It's a natural process that happens to everyone. When we're young, our bodies are strong and healthy. Our hearts beat fast, and our skin looks smooth. But as we age, our hearts beat slower, and our skin gets wrinkles. This happens because our bodies start to wear out. Our cells get tired, and we might get sick more easily. Even though aging is a natural part of life, it's not always easy. We can try to stay healthy by eating well, exercising, and taking care of ourselves.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'human aging' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level.
To explain 'human aging' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level, I should use simple vocabulary and concepts that they can relate to. I can compare human aging to other things that they might understand, such as plants growing and then dying, or animals aging and eventually passing away. I should also explain that human aging is a natural process that happens over time, and that it affects how our bodies look and feel.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For the Upper Elementary level, I should use vocabulary that is easy to understand and sentence structures that are simple and clear. I can use short sentences and basic phrases, and avoid using jargon or complicated concepts. For example, I can use words like ""grow"", ""change"", and ""natural"" to explain human aging.
