Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Step 4: Review and edit your paragraph.

Step 1: To explain 'human aging' at the Advanced College level, we should focus on the biological processes that occur over time, leading to changes in physical and mental abilities, as well as increased risk of disease. We can discuss various theories of aging, such as cellular and molecular changes, oxidative stress, and telomere shortening.

Step 2: To select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, we should use advanced academic vocabulary like 'progressive', 'deterioration','mechanisms', 'theories', and 'epigenetic modifications'. We can use complex sentence structures with conjunctions and relative clauses to connect ideas.

Step 3: Here's a paragraph following the plan (50 words):

""Human aging is a progressive biological process characterized by a generalized deterioration of physiological functions. It is underpinned by various mechanisms, including cellular senescence, oxidative stress, and telomere shortening. Numerous theories have been proposed to explain",12.1,37.81,14.6,13.9,13.23,15.08,5.68,10.333333333333334

Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Step 4: Check your work. Ensure the paragraph is coherent and flows well, contains no errors in grammar, punctuation, spelling, or word choice, and meets the word count requirement.
Step 5: If necessary, revise your paragraph based on your check.

Human aging is a complex, multicausal process characterized by progressive, time-dependent functional decline and increased susceptibility to disease and death. This biological phenomenon is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as cellular senescence and telomere shortening, and extrinsic factors like environmental toxins and lifestyle choices. The study of aging, or gerontology, aims to understand and mitigate these processes to extend healthspan and lifespan.

Human aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by progressive physiological changes that occur over time. It is marked by declines in various biological functions, including cellular repair mechanisms, immune function, and cognitive abilities. This process is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetic predispositions, and extrinsic factors, such as lifestyle choices and environmental exposures.
