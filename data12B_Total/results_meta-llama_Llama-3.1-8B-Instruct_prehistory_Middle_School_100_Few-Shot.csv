In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below.

Prehistory is the period of time before the beginning of written records. During this time, humans developed tools and technology, which greatly improved their way of life. One of the most significant advancements was the discovery of fire, which allowed early humans to cook their food and warm their homes. Without fire, humans would have had a much harder time surviving in the cold, dark environment of the Stone Age. The ability to control fire also led to the development of new tools and techniques, marking the beginning of a more advanced era in human history. Fire changed everything. .

The artifacts we find in prehistory are clues to the lives of people who lived long ago. We discover these items in various places: at the bottom of rivers, in caves, and even in the ground. A piece of bone, a stone tool, or a piece of pottery can reveal a lot about the past. If we are lucky, we might even find the remains of an old home or a burial ground. By studying these artifacts, we can learn about the people who came before us and what their lives were like. This is what archaeologists do.

Prehistory is the time before history began. That is, it is the time before written records were kept. It started a long, long time ago, when humans first appeared on earth, and lasted until the invention of writing. During this time, people lived in small groups and hunted for food. They made tools from rocks, bones, and stones. Some groups migrated to new lands, while others built shelters and developed new ways of living. The prehistoric era was a time of great change and discovery, but unfortunately, no one left behind any written records to tell us all about it.

During prehistory, humans dwelt in caves and created crude tools from stone and wood. They made fires to cook food and warm themselves, just as the old woman lit her hearth. These early people hunted for animals, and their tools were essential for survival. As they used these tools, they must have felt a sense of relief, similar to the coal's escape from the fire. The bean's fate, of being cooked, was also a reality for many animals. The straw, however, was an essential part of their lives, providing warmth and shelter. Prehistory was a time of struggle and adaptation.

Prehistory is the period of time before written records existed.  It lasted from the earliest human life forms to around 4000 years ago, when people started writing.  This time span includes the lives of our ancient ancestors, like cavemen.  Our ancestors lived in small groups, hunting and gathering food, and traveling in search of better living conditions.  We know about their lives from archaeological findings, such as fossils and artifacts, which give us clues about how they survived and what their daily lives were like.  Their stories and customs are now part of our history.

Prehistory is the time before written records began. The earth's history began millions of years ago, but human history began much later. Archaeologists, the scientists who study ancient things, use artifacts to learn about the past. They look for tools, like spears and knives, and other objects that people left behind. They also study the remains of old houses, and the food that people ate. By looking at these clues, archaeologists can piece together what life was like in the past. They can learn about the people who lived long before written records existed.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw.

The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Prehistory refers to the period of time before written records existed. During prehistory, humans lived and thrived without leaving behind the written word. However, our ancestors still left behind tangible evidence, such as tools and artifacts, that give us clues about their lives. The discovery of these remnants allows us to piece together the history of our species, painting a picture of how people lived, hunted, and interacted with one another. It's a journey through time, allowing us to glimpse the lives of our ancient ancestors. Their stories are slowly unraveling, giving us a glimpse of the past.

Dear @writer, your writing is clear and engaging. Here are some suggestions to improve the text: 

1. Use more descriptive language: Consider adding more vivid and engaging adjectives to describe prehistory, such as ""mysterious"", ""fascinating"", or ""en",7.5,76.76,10.1,10.4,10.15,8.24,4.66,11.0

Prehistory was a time before written records. It is a period of human history that started with the emergence of early humans and ended around 5,000 years ago. People during this time did not have the ability to write, so they left behind only material objects and oral traditions. Archaeologists study these objects, like tools and pottery, to understand how people lived. They also try to reconstruct the past using information from other cultures and science. The study of prehistory is like a puzzle, where each piece of evidence helps to complete a picture of the past.

Prehistory began when the first humans appeared on Earth. They had no written records, so archaeologists have to dig for clues. They find tools made from stone, bones, and wood, which tell us about their daily lives. They also discover fossils of long-extinct animals, like mammoths and saber-toothed tigers. By studying these fossils and artifacts, scientists piece together the lives of our ancient ancestors. They learn about how people hunted, farmed, and socialized, giving us a glimpse into a mysterious past that has been hidden for centuries. Their findings help us understand how humans evolved over time.  (103 words)

Prehistory is the time before writing began. During this time, people lived without recording their experiences and events. They were hunter-gatherers, constantly moving to find food and shelter. Their daily life was spent searching for berries, nuts, and small game. They used stones and sticks to make tools and build homes. Their societies were often small and tribal. Little is known about prehistoric life, but it is believed that early humans used caves as shelter and that early civilizations developed in fertile river valleys. Many theories have been formed about this time period based on discoveries and artifacts.

## Step 1: Identify the vocabulary and structure used in examples.
In Example 1, we see the use of phrases such as ""from whence do you come here,"" which is a formal and somewhat archaic way of asking where someone comes from. The structure of the text is also notable, with each character (the coal, the bean, and the straw) speaking in turn. In Example 2,",7.3,77.16,9.6,9.5,9.75,8.01,4.65,11.0
