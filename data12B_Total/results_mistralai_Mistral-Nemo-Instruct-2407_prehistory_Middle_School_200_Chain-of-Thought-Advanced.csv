**Final Output:**

Prehistory is the time before written records. It started about 3 million years ago when our early human ancestors first appeared. These ancestors were called hominids. They lived in Africa and later spread to other parts of the world. Prehistory ended around 3300 BC when people started writing history down. This period is important for understanding how humans evolved and how they first formed societies. Archaeologists study prehistory by finding and examining old tools, bones, and other artifacts.",7.2,61.22,9.2,9.8,7.74,10.99,4.07,4.454545454545454

Prehistory is the time before written records were kept. It starts from the beginning of human life on Earth, around 6 million years ago, until the invention of writing, about 5,000 years ago. This era is divided into three main periods: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. Each period is named after the most common material used for tools and weapons. During prehistory, humans lived as hunter-gatherers, relying on nature for food and shelter. They had no permanent homes and moved from place to place as needed. Over time, humans learned to farm and build permanent settlements, which eventually led to the development of civilizations and the invention of writing. This marked the end of prehistory and the beginning of history.",7.1,66.84,9.2,10.8,8.85,10.19,4.16,5.0

    sentences = len(text.split('. '))
    syllables = sum(len(word) - sum(1 for char in word if char.lower() in 'aeiou') for word in text.split())
    return 0.39 * (words / sentences) + 11.8 * (syllables / words) - 15.59

# example usage
text = ""Prehistory is the period before written records began. It covers all time up to the invention of writing.""

Plan:
- Define 'prehistory' as the time before written records.
- Explain that it includes the Stone Age, which is further divided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods.
- Briefly mention some of the key developments during these periods, such as the invention of tools and agriculture.

Output:
""Prehistory is the time before written records. It includes the Stone Age, which is divided into three parts: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. During the Paleolithic, early humans made simple stone tools. In the Mesolithic, they started using better tools and hunting techniques. Finally, in the Neolithic, people learned to farm and build homes from stone or wood.""
