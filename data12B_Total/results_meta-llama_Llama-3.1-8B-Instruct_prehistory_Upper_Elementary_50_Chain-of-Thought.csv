Prehistory is the time before written records existed. People lived and built homes, hunted and farmed. They made tools from stones, bones, and wood. We know about prehistory from artifacts like tools, pottery, and fossils that were left behind.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level.
To explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level, I need to consider what they already know and what they can understand. This age group is likely familiar with basic concepts of history and time, but may not have a clear grasp of the term 'prehistory'. I should use simple vocabulary and avoid complex historical concepts.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For an Upper Elementary level, I should use vocabulary that is clear and easy to understand. I should also break up the paragraph into short, manageable",8.4,58.18,9.2,10.7,7.69,10.25,3.6,5.666666666666667

Step 4: Review your paragraph to make sure it is clear and accurate.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level.
To explain prehistory to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level, we need to focus on making it easy to understand and interesting. We can start by explaining that prehistory is the time before written records existed. This is a period when people didn't write down their history, so we have to use other clues to learn about it.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For an Upper Elementary level, we should use simple vocabulary and sentence structure. We can use short sentences and try to avoid complex historical terms. For example, instead of saying ""archaeological evidence,"" we can say ""things we dig up.""

Prehistory is the time before written records existed. People lived, hunted, and gathered food without leaving behind written clues. Archaeologists use artifacts and other evidence to learn about prehistoric times. They can figure out how people lived, what they ate, and how they made tools.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Upper Elementary level.
To explain prehistory to someone at the Upper Elementary level, I should start by explaining what prehistory is and what it's not. This will help them understand the context. I can then move on to explaining how archaeologists learn about prehistoric times, using evidence and artifacts.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For an Upper Elementary reader, I should use vocabulary that is clear and concise. I can use simple sentence structures to make it easy to follow.
