Human aging is when our bodies change over time. We grow, then we stop growing, and we start to slow down. Our skin gets wrinkles, and our hair turns gray. Our muscles get weaker, and we can't run as fast as before. Inside our bodies, cells stop dividing as quickly. This is because our telomeres, which protect our chromosomes, get shorter with each division. When they reach zero, the cell can't divide anymore. This process happens to all of us as we get older. It's a natural part of life.",5.0,77.84,5.6,7.6,6.53,6.82,3.96,4.5

Here's the plan:
- Start by defining aging as a process that happens to everyone.
- Explain that aging means our bodies change over time.
- Mention some of the changes that happen, such as growing taller and stronger when we're young, and slower movements and gray hair as we get older.
- End by emphasizing that aging is a normal part of life.

Here's the paragraph:
""Human aging is a natural process that happens to everyone. As we grow older, our bodies change. When we're young, we grow taller and stronger. But as we get older, we move slower, and our hair might turn gray. These changes are all part of life.""
