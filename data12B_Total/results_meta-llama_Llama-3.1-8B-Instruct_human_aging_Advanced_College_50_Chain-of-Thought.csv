Step 5: Include a conclusion that summarizes the main points.
Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process that involves the gradual deterioration of physical, cognitive, and emotional functions. This decline is influenced by various factors, including genetic predisposition, lifestyle choices, and environmental stressors.
As humans age, their cells undergo telomere shortening, leading to reduced cellular division and increased susceptibility to mutations. Simultaneously, the accumulation of oxidative stress and epigenetic modifications disrupts gene expression, contributing to the development of age-related diseases such as cancer, Alzheimer's, and cardiovascular disease. Furthermore, the decline of the immune system compromises its ability to respond to pathogens, making older adults more susceptible to infections.
The interplay between genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors also plays a crucial role in shaping the aging process. For instance, a sedentary lifestyle",13.0,30.06,15.0,13.8,14.57,16.47,6.52,8.714285714285714

Human Aging
Human aging is a complex process that involves the gradual deterioration of the body's physiological systems over time. This process is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, including lifestyle choices, nutrition, and exposure to stress and disease. As we age, our cells and tissues undergo a series of changes that affect our physical and mental abilities. (50-word paragraph",8.7,57.47,9.5,10.8,10.29,10.66,5.01,5.555555555555555
