Prehistory is the period of time before written records exist. It spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. This era is characterized by the development of tools, the rise of complex societies, and the evolution of cultures. The study of prehistory relies on archaeological evidence, such as fossils, artifacts, and rock art, to reconstruct the lives of our ancient ancestors. By examining the material remains of the past, researchers can gain insights into the social, economic, and environmental contexts of prehistoric societies. This knowledge helps us understand how human societies have changed over time and how they have adapted to their environments. The study of prehistory is essential for understanding our shared human history and the complexities of our modern world.

The prehistoric period spans from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of writing, typically around 5,000 years ago. This era, also known as the pre-literary period, is characterized by the development of early human societies, the emergence of complex social structures, and the beginning of agriculture and domestication of animals. The prehistoric period can be further divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). Each period is marked by distinct technological, social, and cultural advancements, reflecting the dynamic evolution of early human societies. The prehistoric period is a crucial part of human history, providing valuable insights into the origins of human societies, the development of technology, and the impact of environmental factors on human populations.

Prehistory refers to the time period preceding written records, encompassing the entirety of human existence prior to the advent of writing. During this era, human societies developed complex social structures, harnessed technology, and interacted with their environments in ways that laid the groundwork for the emergence of civilizations. The prehistoric record is primarily composed of archaeological findings, oral traditions, and the natural environment, which have been pieced together by historians and archaeologists to reconstruct the lives of our ancestors. This period spans millions of years, with various stages of human evolution, migration, and cultural development, ultimately giving rise to the diverse array of human cultures and societies we see today. By studying prehistory, we can gain a deeper understanding of the human experience, the impact of technological advancements, and the intricate relationships between human societies and their environments.
