Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 150 words. In prehistory, human beings lived without the aid of written records. Our understanding of prehistory relies heavily on archaeological evidence, which includes artifacts, tools, and other remains of past cultures. The prehistoric period can be divided into several phases: the Paleolithic era, which spanned from the emergence of early humans (Homo sapiens) to around 10,000 BCE; the Mesolithic era, which lasted from 10,000 to 5,000 BCE; and the Neolithic era, which began around 5,000 BCE. During this time, humans developed basic tools, learned to control fire, and eventually developed more complex societies and civilizations. The discovery of fossils, ancient settlements, and other artifacts has provided valuable insights into the lives of our prehistoric ancestors.

Imagine a time before written records existed. This is what we call prehistory. To learn about prehistory, scientists study old artifacts, tools, and other remains of past cultures. They divide prehistory into three main periods: the Paleolithic era (when early humans first appeared), the Mesolithic era (around 10,000 to 5,000 BCE), and the Neolithic era (around 5,000 BCE). During this time, humans learned to use tools, control fire, and build complex societies. Scientists have found fossils, ancient homes, and other clues that help us understand our ancestors. By studying prehistory, we can learn about human evolution, how people lived, and how societies developed over time. It's like piecing together a big puzzle!  (150 words)

The prehistoric period started about 2.5 million years ago when the first humans appeared in Africa. This time period ended when people began writing in Mesopotamia around 3500 BC. During this time, early humans made tools, hunted and gathered food, and moved to different parts of the world. The prehistoric period is divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic period is also known as the Old Stone Age. People used stone tools and hunted for food. The Mesolithic period saw the development of more complex societies and the use of small stone tools.

Prehistory is the time before writing existed. It starts with the first humans and ends when people began writing things down. Since there are no written records, historians use other clues like old buildings, tools, and stories passed down through generations to learn about our ancestors. This period is divided into stages like the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic ages. During these times, humans went from being nomadic hunters and gatherers to farmers who lived in settled communities. They developed new tools and ways of living. Prehistory also saw the rise of complex societies, art, and early civilizations. Even though we can't read about it in books, prehistory is still a fascinating time that helps us understand how human societies evolved and how we got to where we are today.

**Prehistory: The Time Before Writing**

Prehistory is the time before people kept written records. It started when the first humans appeared and ended when writing was developed. During this time, people used archaeological evidence and oral stories to tell about their lives. The prehistoric period can be divided into three main stages: the Paleolithic Era, the Mesolithic Era, and the Neolithic Era. In these periods, people made tools, developed languages, and built societies. They also started to farm and domesticate animals. The prehistoric period saw the rise of complex societies, like ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China.
