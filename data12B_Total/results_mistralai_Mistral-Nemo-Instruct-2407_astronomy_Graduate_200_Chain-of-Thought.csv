Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects, phenomena, and processes, is a multifaceted discipline that encompasses a vast array of phenomena, from the intricacies of stellar evolution to the expansive cosmological scales of the universe. At its core, astronomy is an observational science, reliant on precise measurements and meticulous data analysis to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos. This necessitates a profound understanding of both classical and quantum physics, as well as mathematics, to interpret the complex signals and data sets garnered from advanced telescopes and space-based instruments. For instance, the study of variable stars, such as Cepheids, employs intricate statistical analyses to deduce their intrinsic properties and distances, thereby serving as cosmic yardsticks. Similarly, the detection and characterization of exoplanets, worlds orbiting other stars, hinge on sophisticated signal processing techniques to discern the minuscule gravitational tugs these planets exert on their parent stars.
