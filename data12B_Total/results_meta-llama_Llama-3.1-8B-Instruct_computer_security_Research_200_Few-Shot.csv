An electrostatic generator, or electrostatic machine, is an electromechanical generator that produces static electricity, or electricity at high voltage and low continuous current. The knowledge of static electricity dates back to the earliest civilizations, but for millennia it remained merely an interesting and mystifying phenomenon, without a theory to explain its behavior and often confused with magnetism. By the end of the 17th Century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction, but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies about the new science of electricity. Electrostatic generators operate by using manual (or other) power to transform mechanical work into electric energy. Electrostatic generators develop electrostatic charges of opposite signs rendered to two conductors, using only electric forces, and work by using moving plates, drums, or belts to carry electric charge to a high potential electrode. The charge is generated by one of two methods: either the triboelectric effect (friction) or electrostatic induction.

An electrostatic generator, or electrostatic machine, is an electromechanical generator that produces static electricity, or electricity at high voltage and low continuous current. The knowledge of static electricity dates back to the earliest civilizations, but for millennia it remained merely an interesting and mystifying phenomenon, without a theory to explain its behavior and often confused with magnetism. By the end of the 17th Century, researchers had developed practical means of generating electricity by friction, but the development of electrostatic machines did not begin in earnest until the 18th century, when they became fundamental instruments in the studies about the new science of electricity. Electrostatic generators operate by using manual (or other) power to transform mechanical work into electric energy. Electrostatic generators develop electrostatic charges of opposite signs rendered to two conductors, using only electric forces, and work by using moving plates, drums, or belts to carry electric charge to a high potential electrode. The charge is generated by one of two methods: either the triboelectric effect (friction) or electrostatic induction.

Computer security, or cybersecurity, is an area of research and practice that focuses on protecting computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, use, or disclosure. The history of computer security dates back to the 19th century, when researchers began to explore the potential of machines to compute and communicate. However, it wasn't until the 20th century that the field of computer security began to take shape, with the development of encryption techniques and the first computer viruses. Computer security operates by using algorithms and protocols to transform data into secure forms, and work by using encryption keys, digital signatures, and other cryptographic techniques to protect data and prevent unauthorized access. The security of computer systems and networks is essential for protecting sensitive information, preventing financial losses, and maintaining public trust. Computer security is a rapidly evolving field, with new threats and challenges emerging every day. As a result, researchers and practitioners must continually adapt and innovate to stay ahead of the latest threats and ensure the security of computer systems and networks.",18.3,21.67,20.6,18.4,18.59,14.23,7.57,26.0
