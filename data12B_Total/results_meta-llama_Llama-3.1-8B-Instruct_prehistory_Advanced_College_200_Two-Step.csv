The period of prehistory, spanning from approximately 6-8 million years ago to the advent of written records around 5,000 years ago, is a complex and multifaceted era. This period is typically divided into three distinct phases: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During prehistory, early humans evolved from primates and dispersed from Africa to colonize various regions of the world. As humans adapted to diverse environments, they developed sophisticated tools and technologies, and began to establish complex societies. The Paleolithic period saw the emergence of Homo erectus and the development of rudimentary stone tools. The Mesolithic period witnessed the refinement of stone tools and the emergence of hunting and gathering practices. The Neolithic period marked the transition to settled agriculture and the domestication of animals, laying the groundwork for the development of civilizations.

Prehistory refers to the vast expanse of time preceding the advent of written records, spanning approximately 2.5 million years to 4,000 years ago. This era saw the emergence of humans from primates, accompanied by the development of tools and the initial stages of social organization. Early humans existed as hunter-gatherers, inhabiting small, nomadic groups and relying on fire, stone tools, and rudimentary technology for survival. As societies evolved, some groups became more settled and transitioned to agriculture, marking a pivotal shift towards more complex and organized communities. The invention of writing around 4,000 years ago demarcated the end of prehistory and the commencement of recorded history.
