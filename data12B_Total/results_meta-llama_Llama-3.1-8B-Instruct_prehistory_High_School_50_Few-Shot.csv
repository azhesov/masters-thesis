Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

Prehistory refers to the period of human existence before the advent of written records. Archaeologists rely on excavations, artifacts, and other non-written sources to reconstruct this time. The study of prehistory allows us to understand early human societies, migrations, and cultural developments. Interpretation is crucial to piecing together the past.  The study of prehistory is vast and complex, involving many disciplines. It seeks to uncover the unknown and shed light on the earliest human experiences. The history of prehistory is a dynamic and ongoing field, with new discoveries continually challenging and refining our understanding.  It is a discipline that seeks to uncover the origins of human civilizations and cultures, a quest that has captivated humans for centuries.  This field is not a simple or straightforward endeavor.  It requires a combination of scientific, social, and historical perspectives.  This study is not just about the past, but about us today.

Prehistory refers to the period before written records, spanning millions of years. This era saw the emergence of early humans, development of tools, and the rise of complex societies. It is an age of discovery, with artifacts and fossils revealing the lives of ancient peoples.  It's a vast, uncharted territory.  The dawn of human history began in Africa, where early humans evolved.  The history of prehistory remains a subject of ongoing research and debate.  Our understanding of this era is constantly evolving.  Its mysteries are slowly being uncovered.  Fossils and artifacts are being found in increasing numbers.  New discoveries are shedding light on the lives of early humans.  The more we learn, the more we realize how little we know.  The study of prehistory is a fascinating journey.  It takes us back to the beginning of human history.  It reveals the early struggles and triumphs of our ancestors.  It shows us the gradual development of human societies.",9.5,55.24,10.4,12.7,10.62,10.9,4.83,15.25

Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

Prehistory, a vast period, spans over 2.5 million years. The era before recorded history, it encompasses the development of early humans and the evolution of life on Earth. The landscape, the climate, and the people, all underwent significant changes during this time. It was a period of discovery.  The transition to agriculture, the development of tools, and the emergence of complex societies, all laid the foundation for the modern world.  The study of prehistory, through archaeology and anthropology, helps us understand our past and the origins of human civilization.​  The discovery of ancient artifacts, such as fossils, and the deciphering of written symbols, provide valuable insights into the lives of our ancestors.  Through these findings, we can glimpse the lives of the people who lived before us.​
