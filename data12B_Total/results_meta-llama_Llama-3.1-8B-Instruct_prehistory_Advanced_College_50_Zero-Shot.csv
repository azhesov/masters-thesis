Prehistory refers to the period of human existence before written records. It encompasses the entirety of human evolution, from the emergence of the first hominins to the advent of writing systems. This vast expanse of time is often divided into Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. These eras are characterized by significant technological and societal advancements. The prehistoric era is marked by the development of tools, the domestication of plants and animals, and the rise of complex societies. Ultimately, it laid the foundation for the modern world. This time period, spanning over 99% of human history, is shrouded in mystery and subject to ongoing archaeological and anthropological research. As new discoveries are made, our understanding of prehistory continues to evolve. By studying this era, we gain insights into the lives of our ancestors and the evolution of human societies. The prehistoric period is a crucial chapter in the narrative of human history. It is marked by innovation, adaptation, and resilience.",10.9,40.85,11.8,13.6,13.58,13.74,5.58,8.5

The prehistoric period spans from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of writing. This era, characterized by the absence of written records, is divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. Each period showcases human development and technological advancements. The Paleolithic period, marked by the use of stone tools, was the earliest of these periods. The Mesolithic period introduced more refined tools and complex societies, while the Neolithic period saw the development of agriculture and settled communities.

The period before written records began is known as prehistory. This era spans from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of writing. During prehistory, societies developed complex systems of governance and subsistence, often leaving behind tangible artifacts such as tools, architecture, and art. These remnants provide valuable insights into the lives and cultures of our ancient ancestors. Archaeologists rely on these artifacts to reconstruct the past, while historians often focus on the periods with written records.
