Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war.

A state of armed neutrality is the stance of a country that maintains readiness to defend itself against incursions from all parties in a conflict, while not taking sides. Similarly, a computer security posture involves being prepared to defend against all types of cyber threats, without being aligned with any particular group or entity. This includes keeping software and systems up-to-date, using strong passwords, and implementing robust firewalls and intrusion detection systems. By maintaining an armed neutrality-like posture, a computer system can effectively protect itself against various cyber threats and maintain its integrity. Security is maintained without favoring any one party.",13.9,38.55,16.0,15.4,14.52,13.58,6.22,17.75

Computer security refers to the protection of computer systems and networks from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. The primary goal of computer security is to protect the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data and systems. This can be achieved through various measures such as firewalls, encryption, access control, and intrusion detection systems. Additionally, secure coding practices and regular software updates can also help prevent security breaches. A secure computer system is one that is resistant to unauthorized access, modification, or disruption. Effective computer security measures are essential to prevent data breaches and maintain the integrity of computer systems.

It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Cybersecurity is a posture of a network or system, which makes no agreement with malicious entities. It asserts that it will defend itself against resulting cyber incursions from all parties. This may include, firewall configurations without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a secure network in the virtual world; readiness to counter with force an invasion of digital rights by any hacker power. Cybersecurity is a term used in digital politics, which is the condition of a secure network, at risk, which holds itself ready to resist by force any digital aggression.

Here are some suggestions to improve the paragraph:

* Consider using a more concrete and specific example to illustrate the concept of cybersecurity, such as a company's network being protected from hackers.
* Use simpler vocabulary to convey the same message. For example, ""digital rights",13.4,39.87,14.7,15.1,13.34,12.65,5.79,17.75

The posture of a nation with robust computer security measures is similar to armed neutrality in international politics. It assumes no alliance with malicious actors but prepares for potential cyber attacks from all directions. The aim of robust computer security is to protect domestic digital industry from foreign threats. For instance, a country may maintain a strong cybersecurity posture by enforcing strict data protection laws and investing in advanced threat detection systems. This posture aims to safeguard domestic digital assets while defending against potential cyber threats from any source. Such a posture is crucial in today’s digital age. ",13.3,39.97,16.1,15.4,13.91,13.35,6.05,17.75

The term computer security is used to describe the measures taken to protect computer systems and networks from cyber attacks. A posture of armed neutrality, in the realm of computer security, would be a defense strategy that neither commits to nor betrays a particular security approach. This might include maintaining military-grade firewalls without pledging allegiance to a particular security standard. Armed neutrality in computer security would be the stance of a system that remains prepared to counter threats from all parties, while asserting its right to defend itself against any incursion into its digital territory. This stance ensures a state of readiness.  The system maintains readiness to defend itself against any possible threat.  This allows the system to adapt to changing threats.  The system is able to respond to any threat in a timely manner.  This is the essence of armed neutrality in computer security.   The system remains vigilant and proactive in its defense strategy.   The system is able to detect and respond to threats in real-time.   This allows the system to",12.3,42.51,13.5,14.1,12.12,12.59,5.53,17.75
