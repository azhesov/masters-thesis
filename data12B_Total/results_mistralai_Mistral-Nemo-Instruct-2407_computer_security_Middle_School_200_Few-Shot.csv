In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In the digital world, a poor old computer sat in a room, filled with important data. A hacker, like a burning coal, wanted to leap in and steal it. The computer had a password, like the straw, and asked, ""Who are you?"" The hacker replied, ""I escaped from another computer and I'm here to steal your data."" The computer said, ""I'm protected, I won't let you in like you did to others."" The hacker, frustrated, left to find an easier target.",8.0,75.44,9.6,9.5,10.09,6.85,4.75,11.0

A computer in a home office had a problem. It was connected to the internet, but its security was weak. A hacker tried to enter the computer, like a straw burning near a bean. The computer's firewall, like a strong barrier, blocked the hacker, preventing any harm. The computer also had updated antivirus software, ready to protect like a brave soldier. It scanned for threats, ensuring the computer stayed safe. The user then created strong passwords, making it harder for hackers to break in. The computer was now secure, like a well-guarded treasure.",7.5,76.66,9.5,9.8,9.97,7.54,4.75,11.0

In a bustling office, a dedicated computer hummed, keeping important files safe. One day, a tiny, invisible worm, known as a virus, crept in. It had escaped a digital fire, just like the coal in the story. The computer, trying to protect itself, struggled against the intruder. It was like the bean trying to avoid becoming broth. The virus wanted to make the computer do harmful things, just as the straw didn't want to be burned. Special security software, like a wise old woman, was called in. It quickly found the virus and threw it out, saving the computer from trouble. Just like the beans and the straw, the computer and the virus had different fates.

When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In a big office, there's a special computer. This computer holds important secrets, like passwords and personal information. A bad person wants to steal these secrets, so the office takes great care to protect the computer. They put it in a special room, away from curious eyes. Only trusted people can enter, and even then, they must use a secret code. The computer also has a strong shield, like a firewall, that guards against sneaky attacks from the internet. This shield is always on, watching for danger. If something tries to break in, the shield quickly blocks it. The office also makes regular checks to make sure everything is safe. They update the computer's protection and teach the trusted people about new threats. This way, the computer and its secrets stay safe.",7.2,77.47,9.2,9.2,9.28,7.66,4.47,11.0

In the world of computers, security is like the fire in the old woman's kitchen. It protects the valuable information we store, just as the fire cooks the beans. Computer security starts with a strong password, which is like the straw that begins the fire. A weak password, or using the same password for many accounts, is like using a single match to start a big fire - it's easy to blow out or steal. To protect our data, we use special software, like the coal that jumps from the fire. This software watches for dangerous threats, like viruses and hackers, and blocks them before they can cause harm. Just like the beans that escaped the pan, our data stays safe and secure, thanks to computer security.",8.4,74.42,10.4,9.3,10.27,7.31,4.91,11.0
