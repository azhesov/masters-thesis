Astronomy, a branch of physics and natural philosophy, is the systematic study of celestial objects, spaces, and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere. It is an ancient science, with roots tracing back to the Babylonians and Greeks, but has evolved significantly with technological advancements, now employing complex instruments and advanced mathematical models to understand the cosmos. Astronomy encompasses various subfields, including astrophysics, which explores the physical properties and behavior of celestial bodies, and astrobiology, which investigates the potential for life beyond Earth. At its core, astronomy seeks to answer fundamental questions about the universe's origin, evolution, and ultimate fate, continually pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and imagination.",14.9,25.08,17.8,16.4,17.66,17.06,7.02,12.333333333333334

**Model Answer:**

Astronomy, a fundamental branch of science, is the systematic study of celestial bodies and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It encompasses a vast spectrum of disciplines, including cosmology, the study of the universe as a whole, and astrophysics, which applies the principles of physics to explain celestial objects and phenomena. Astronomy employs a range of scientific methods, from mathematical models and theoretical physics to direct observation and data analysis, to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos. It has significantly contributed to our understanding of the universe's origin, evolution, and ultimate fate, while continually pushing the boundaries of human knowledge.",12.6,36.39,14.7,14.4,15.11,14.56,6.3,8.571428571428571
