Prehistory is the time before history, before people started writing things down. It's like when you're telling a story, but you don't have a notebook to write it in. Imagine the world thousands of years ago, before cars, computers, or even books. That's the prehistoric era. People lived as hunters and gatherers, using tools made from stones or bones. They drew pictures on cave walls to tell stories. Scientists study prehistoric times by looking at fossils and artifacts, trying to understand how people lived long before we had pencils or pens.",5.7,76.01,8.5,9.3,7.87,9.9,4.03,5.555555555555555

Prehistory is the time before we had written records. It's like a big history puzzle where we don't have all the pieces. Archaeologists, scientists who study old things, help us solve this puzzle by looking at fossils, tools, and art from long ago. They help us understand how people lived thousands of years before anyone could write down their stories. So, prehistory is like the first chapter of our history book, but we have to read between the lines to understand it.",7.5,65.83,8.9,10.3,7.8,9.79,3.83,6.625
