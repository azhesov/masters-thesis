Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It employs the principles of physics, chemistry, and mathematics to understand the universe's origins, evolution, and structure. Astronomers observe celestial bodies like stars, galaxies, and planets using telescopes, both on Earth and in space, to gather data and make discoveries about the cosmos. This interdisciplinary field also encompasses the history, philosophy, and sociology of astronomy, providing a comprehensive perspective on humanity's understanding and exploration of the universe.",13.6,28.43,15.5,15.0,15.48,15.83,6.26,11.5

Astronomy, a subfield of physics, is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It encompasses a broad spectrum of topics, including the nature of stars, the formation and evolution of galaxies, the properties of black holes, and the origins and evolution of the universe itself. Astronomers employ a diverse range of tools and techniques, from ground-based telescopes and space-based observatories to theoretical models and simulations, to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos.",11.1,45.86,13.5,13.3,13.54,13.86,6.06,8.571428571428571

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It employs physics, mathematics, and chemistry to explain their origin and evolution. Astronomers observe celestial bodies like stars, planets, galaxies, and examine the universe's large-scale properties, such as dark matter and dark energy. They also investigate phenomena like black holes, gamma-ray bursts, and cosmic microwave background radiation. Observations are typically made using ground-based telescopes or space-based observatories, with data analysis often involving complex computational methods. The ultimate goal of astronomy is to understand the universe's structure, origin, and evolution, as well as the physical laws that govern its behavior.",12.8,30.46,15.1,14.1,13.93,16.53,5.86,8.0
