Prehistory was the time before people wrote things down. It's hard to know what happened because we don't have any records of it. But we can look at the things people made and used to learn about them. We can see how they made tools and shelters, and how they hunted for food. We can also see the places where they lived. People made a lot of things out of stone, like arrowheads and axes. They also made homes out of stone and mud. Looking at these things helps us understand what life was like in prehistory. By studying these old things, we can learn about the people who came before us. It's like trying to piece together a big puzzle, and each new discovery helps us see a little clearer picture of the past.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 150 words. The term 'prehistoric' refers to the time before written records. 
During prehistory, humans lived in groups, which were sometimes nomadic. They migrated to places with abundant food and shelter. In the early prehistoric period, people hunted wild animals for food and built temporary homes. As humans developed more tools, they began to settle in one place. These early settlers started to farm the land, planting seeds and harvesting crops. They made homes from wood and stone, some of which still stand today. In prehistory, humans also created art, such as cave paintings. The first art was created about 40,000 years ago in a cave in France. The prehistoric period ended with the invention of writing, which allowed people to keep records of their lives and events.

The people of prehistory did not have houses or clothes like we do. They lived in small groups and made their own tools. They hunted animals and gathered fruits and berries to eat. Some people were good at making things from stones and bones. They made sharp knives and spear points. Others were good at making fire, which they used to cook their food and keep warm. The people of prehistory also learned how to make clothes from animal skins. They sewed them together with threads made from plants. They did not have meetings or teams like we do, but they worked together to survive. They were a clever people, and they paved the way for our modern world.  In the end, they became known as our ancestors.  The men and women of prehistory became a part of our history.

Prehistory was a time when humans didn't leave behind written records. This made it difficult for historians to learn about the lives of people during this period. Archaeologists, however, have been able to study the tools, homes, and artifacts that people left behind. They found evidence of early humans making fire and controlling it. People also made tools from rocks and wood. These tools were used for hunting and gathering. By studying these artifacts, we can understand that early humans lived in small groups and were skilled at making things. We can also see that they had a basic understanding of math and geometry. These findings have helped us learn about the daily lives of people in prehistory. They have also helped us understand how early humans developed their skills and knowledge.",6.9,72.97,8.5,9.9,8.71,8.63,4.13,7.142857142857142

Prehistory is a very old time. People lived before the invention of writing. No one knows exactly when writing began, but it is believed to have started around 5,000 years ago. Before that, people told stories by drawing pictures and making carvings. They also passed down stories by word of mouth. Prehistoric people hunted animals, gathered fruits and berries, and made tools from rocks and sticks. They made homes from animal hides, branches, and stones. They were nomads, traveling from place to place, following the animals. In the ice age, they were able to make fire. This made them able to cook their food and stay warm in the cold weather. They were able to make more complex tools and homes, which helped them to live better lives. Prehistory is a time that is hard to understand, but it is an important part of our history.

The time before history is called prehistory. This is because we don't have written records from that time. Archaeologists, however, have found artifacts and other objects that help them understand what life was like back then. They study these artifacts to learn more about people's daily lives, their tools, and their cultures. By analyzing these objects, they can figure out what people did, what they ate, and how they lived. They can also learn about the different groups of people who lived in a certain area. This helps us understand how our ancestors lived and how they contributed to the world we live in today. It's like piecing together a big puzzle, and archaeologists are the detectives who help us uncover the clues.

When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 150 words. Here is the prehistory content: 

Prehistory is the time before written records existed. It is estimated to have lasted from the emergence of the first humans, about 2.5 million years ago, until the invention of writing, which occurred around 5,500 years ago. During this time, people developed tools, language, and social structures. They also hunted and gathered food and eventually started farming. Some of the earliest known civilizations, such as ancient Egypt and Mesopotamia, date back to the prehistoric period. People in these civilizations developed complex societies, built cities, and created art and writing. These early societies left behind artifacts and other evidence that provide clues about their lives and cultures. By studying these artifacts and other evidence, archaeologists can learn more about the prehistoric world and its people. Prehistory is a time that is still being studied today.

Prehistory is a time before written records. It is the period from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. During this time, people lived in small groups, hunting and gathering food. They also made simple tools from stone and wood. The earliest humans, called Paleolithic humans, were nomadic and lived in caves. They followed the food sources, such as animals and plants, to survive. As time passed, people began to settle in one place and form tribes. They developed more complex tools and made early forms of art, such as cave paintings. The people of prehistory were skilled at adapting to their environment and were able to thrive in a variety of settings. They laid the foundation for the development of civilizations. Their way of life was vastly different from ours today. .​

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 150 words. 
The term 'prehistory' was first used by the German historian Augustus Boeckh in 1851. He wanted to describe the time period before written records existed. For thousands of years, people lived in the world without leaving behind any written accounts of their lives. Before the invention of writing, people told stories, passed down traditions, and communicated through art and symbols. It was a time of great discovery and innovation. People learned to make tools, develop agriculture, and domesticate animals. The prehistoric period ended with the invention of writing, which was a major breakthrough in human history. The discovery of written records allowed people to leave behind a written legacy, providing a glimpse into the lives of our ancient ancestors.

Here's a paragraph that's closer to the original examples:

Here is the paragraph:
Before the invention of writing, prehistory was the period of time when early humans did not leave behind written records. We can only imagine what life was like. Some of the earliest humans were nomads, traveling from place to place in search of food. They hunted animals and gathered plants. These early humans were skilled at making tools, like stone knives and wooden spears. They lived in caves or simple shelters. We have discovered many artifacts, like fossils, pottery, and cave paintings, that help us understand how people lived back then. These discoveries give us clues about how humans developed and changed over time. By studying prehistory, we can learn more about our ancestors and how they lived. This helps us understand how we came to be the way we are today.
