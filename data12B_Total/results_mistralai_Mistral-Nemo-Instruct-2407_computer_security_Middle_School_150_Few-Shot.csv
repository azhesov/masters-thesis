In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

Malware, much like the straw, can hide and spread silently. To protect our data, we must build a strong firewall, which acts as a guard, preventing unwanted intruders. Just as the old woman was careful with her beans, we should be cautious with our data, keeping it safe and secure.",8.4,74.42,10.3,9.1,10.48,7.14,5.02,11.0

In a world filled with digital dangers, computer security plays a crucial role. It's like having a castle with a moat to keep intruders out. Just as a straw can ignite a fire, a simple email with a harmful link can start a cyber disaster. A strong firewall, much like a sturdy gate, blocks unauthorized access. Regular software updates are like maintaining the castle walls, keeping them strong against new threats. Encryption, the digital equivalent of a secret language, protects sensitive information. So, protect your digital castle with robust security measures.",7.7,76.05,10.0,9.8,10.31,7.83,4.92,11.0

This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

""Computer security is like a strong castle protecting a valuable treasure. Firewalls, like the castle walls, stop bad guys (hackers) from getting in. Antivirus software, like brave knights, searches for and defeats enemies (viruses, malware). Strong passwords, like secret passwords, keep the castle gates locked. Updates, like a wise king's orders, keep everything in good shape. Everyone plays a role in keeping the castle safe, just like everyone using computers must help keep their security strong.""",7.8,75.84,10.3,9.3,9.87,7.95,4.83,11.0

A computer virus is a harmful program that affects your computer. When a virus gets into your computer, it can do many bad things. It can steal your personal information, like passwords and credit card numbers. It can also damage your files and make your computer run very slowly. To protect your computer, you should always have up-to-date security software. This software can help find and remove viruses before they cause any harm. It's also important to be careful when you're online. Don't open emails from people you don't know, and never click on links or download files from suspicious websites. By following these steps, you can keep your computer safe and secure.",7.5,76.76,9.5,9.4,9.4,7.66,4.61,11.0

""Computer security"" is the process of protecting computer systems and networks from digital threats, damage, or unauthorized access. It involves a combination of technical controls and human behavior. The technical controls include software and hardware solutions that prevent, detect, and respond to security incidents. For example, firewalls are like the straw that prevents unwanted access, while antivirus software is like the coal that detects and removes harmful threats. Meanwhile, human behavior, such as strong passwords and regular software updates, plays a crucial role in maintaining computer security. It's like the old woman in the story, who needs to take care of her beans (computers) to prevent them from being harmed. In the same way, everyone using computers must be aware and responsible to ensure their security.",9.5,66.07,11.4,10.8,11.0,8.65,5.22,11.0
