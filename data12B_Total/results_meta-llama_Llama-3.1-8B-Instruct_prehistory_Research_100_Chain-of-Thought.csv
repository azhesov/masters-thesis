Prehistory, by definition, is the time period before written records began, which is a broad and often imprecise term that encompasses the entirety of human existence prior to the invention of writing systems. Archaeologists and historians often focus on the period after the emergence of agriculture, which is around 10,000 years ago, as it is during this time that the earliest settled communities began to leave behind tangible evidence of their existence, such as artifacts and monuments. The study of prehistory relies heavily on the analysis of these physical remains to reconstruct the lives and cultures of ancient societies. 

Step 4: Revise the paragraph to make it more concise and clear.

Prehistory is the time before written records, spanning from the emergence of the first hominids to the advent of writing, approximately 2.5 million to 5,000 years ago. During this period, human societies developed complex social structures, technologies, and cultures, with evidence of these achievements preserved in archaeological sites and artifacts. The prehistoric era is typically divided into three phases: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age), each characterized by distinct technological and cultural developments.

Step  1:  Prehistory is a term used to describe the time period before written records were kept.  This era spans from the emergence of the first humans, around 2.8 million years ago, to the invention of writing, approximately 5,200 years ago.  During this time, human societies developed and evolved without the aid of written documentation.  As a result, our understanding of prehistory is primarily based on archaeological evidence, including tools, artifacts, and other material remains that have been uncovered through excavation.
Step 2: The selected vocabulary is formal and academic, and the sentence structure is complex and includes subordinating conjunctions (e.g., ""as a result"") and relative clauses (e.g., ""including tools, artifacts, and other material remains"").

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. 
Prehistory is the period of time before written records, which allows us to study it using archaeology and anthropology. The lack of written records means that historians rely on material culture and oral traditions to reconstruct the past. Researchers have used artifacts, architecture, and genetics to understand human migration, culture, and technological development. The field is divided into distinct periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each characterized by distinct tool types and subsistence strategies. By studying prehistory, we gain a deeper understanding of human evolution and the development of complex societies.

The final answer is: There is no final numerical answer to this problem, as it requires writing a paragraph of 100 words that explains the concept of prehistory at the Research level. The response above meets the requirements of the problem.

Prehistory is the period before written records existed. It spans from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of writing, which is typically dated around 5,200 years ago. During this time, humans developed complex societies, created tools and art, and domesticated plants and animals. Archaeologists rely on material culture and oral traditions to reconstruct prehistoric societies, which is a challenging task due to the lack of written evidence. As a result, prehistory is often characterized by a patchwork of fragmented knowledge, with different regions and cultures revealing distinct narratives.

Step 5: Check for completeness and clarity.

Here's my first draft:
Prehistory is the period before recorded history, encompassing human existence from the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa to the development of writing systems around 5,000 years ago. During this time, societies were largely oral, relying on storytelling, art, and symbolism to convey knowledge and cultural values. Archaeological evidence, such as artifacts and settlements, provides valuable insights into the lives of prehistoric people, including their technological, social, and economic practices. Prehistory is often divided into distinct periods, such as the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each characterized by significant cultural and technological advancements.

Step  1:  Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the Research level.  
To explain 'prehistory' to someone at the Research level, I would need to consider their prior knowledge and provide a clear, concise definition that incorporates key terms and concepts. This involves understanding their level of expertise and adjusting the language and complexity of the explanation accordingly.

Step 2:  Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For someone at the Research level, I would use technical vocabulary such as ""archaeological record,"" ""Paleolithic era,"" and ""Mesolithic period."" I would also employ complex sentence structures, including subordinate clauses and relative pronouns, to convey nuanced ideas and relationships. For example: ""The prehistoric era, spanning from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the advent of written records, is characterized by the archaeological record's ability to reveal the cultural, social, and technological developments of ancient societies during the Paleolithic era and subsequent Mesolithic period.""",12.9,35.57,15.6,14.1,13.68,15.49,6.01,8.285714285714286
