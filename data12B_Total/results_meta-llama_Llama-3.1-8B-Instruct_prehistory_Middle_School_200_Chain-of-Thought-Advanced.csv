Prehistory is the period before written records. It started when the first humans appeared and ended with the invention of writing. This period is divided into three main sections: the Paleolithic Age, the Mesolithic Age, and the Neolithic Age. The Paleolithic Age, also known as the Stone Age, lasted from 2.6 million to 10,000 years ago. During this time, humans lived in small groups and made tools from stone and wood. The Mesolithic Age followed and lasted from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago. This was a time of transition and saw the development of new tools and the use of stone for making tools. The Neolithic Age, also known as the New Stone Age, lasted from 5,000 to 2,000 years ago. It was a time of great change and saw the development of agriculture and the domestication of animals.

Prehistory refers to the time before written records existed. It is the period of time that came before recorded history. People living during this time left behind artifacts, such as tools, pottery, and other objects that we can study today. These artifacts give us clues about how people lived, what they ate, and how they interacted with their environment.

Archaeologists, who are scientists that study the past, use these artifacts to learn about prehistory. They excavate sites where people once lived, such as ancient settlements, and carefully remove and analyze the artifacts they find. By studying these artifacts, archaeologists can piece together a picture of what life was like in prehistoric times.

The study of prehistory helps us understand the development of human societies and cultures. It also provides insights into the evolution of human behavior, technology, and the environment. By learning about pre",9.7,49.52,10.7,11.9,9.74,11.88,4.39,6.0

Here is the final answer:

Prehistory is a time period before written records. It spans from the emergence of the first humans, to the invention of writing, around 5,000 to 6,000 years ago. During this period, people developed tools, shelter, and social structures. They also domesticated animals and began to farm. As a result, prehistory is divided into several periods, each characterized by unique cultural and technological developments. These periods include the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras, with each era representing significant advances in human evolution and society. By studying prehistory, we can gain a deeper understanding of how our ancestors lived and how they adapted to their environments.

Prehistory refers to the period of time before written records were kept. It began with the emergence of the first humans and ended with the invention of writing. This period is often divided into several sub-periods, such as the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each characterized by significant technological, social, and cultural developments. The study of prehistory is based on the analysis of archaeological findings, including artifacts, tools, and other remains. By examining these remnants, researchers can reconstruct the lives of ancient people and gain insights into their daily activities, social structures, and beliefs.

Here is the final answer:

The study of prehistory is the examination of human societies before the advent of written records. During this period, humans developed complex societies, harnessed the power of agriculture, and created early forms of art and architecture. While we do not have written accounts from this time, archaeologists use artifacts and other evidence to reconstruct the lives of our ancestors. These findings have provided valuable insights into the daily lives, social structures, and technological advancements of ancient societies. The study of prehistory is essential in understanding human evolution, the development of civilizations, and the impact of climate change on human societies. By analyzing the artifacts and evidence from prehistory, we can gain a deeper understanding of the human experience and the processes that shaped our world.

Here is the output:
Prehistory is the period before written records existed. It started around 3.5 million years ago and lasted until the invention of writing. During this time, humans evolved from early primates to complex societies. Early humans developed tools, hunted, and gathered food to survive. They also created early art and burial practices. The earliest writing systems emerged around 5,000 years ago in ancient civilizations such as Mesopotamia and Egypt. The invention of writing marked the beginning of recorded history. The prehistoric period was a time of great change and development for early humans. It laid the foundation for modern societies. The study of prehistory helps us understand how humans evolved and developed over time.
