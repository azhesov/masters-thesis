Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' in 50 words.
The prehistoric era was the time before written records. It began millions of years ago and lasted until humans developed writing. During this time, early humans lived in small groups, hunted for food, and made tools from stone and wood.

Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, so it will target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 5.
The original paragraph is already quite simple. It has 5 sentences and 39 words. I will add a few more words to increase the total words to 50 and make the sentence structure even simpler.

Step 3: Make sure the output has correct metric value.
The original paragraph has 39 words. I will add 11 words to make it 50 words. The new paragraph will have 5 sentences.

The prehistory of our planet began about 4.5 billion years ago. During this time, the Earth was very different. The oceans were formed and life began to grow. Over time, the continents changed and new species emerged. Humans did not appear until much later. They lived in small groups and hunted for food. As time passed, humans developed tools and began to build shelters. The prehistory of our planet is a long and complex period.

Prehistory is a very long time before written history began. People lived on Earth millions of years ago. There were dinosaurs, mammoths, and other creatures. Humans first appeared about 300,000 years ago. Early humans were hunters and gatherers. They used tools made from rocks and sticks. They made fire, built shelters, and took care of their families.

The prehistoric period is very long, starting about 3.5 million years ago and ending around 3,500 years ago. During this time, humans were not yet able to write, and their lives were very different from ours. People lived in small groups, hunted for food, and made tools from stone and wood. The climate was also different, with ice ages and warmer periods. As people developed new tools and ways of living, they were able to make progress and eventually create societies with leaders and rules. The prehistoric period is a time of great discovery and learning about our ancient ancestors.
