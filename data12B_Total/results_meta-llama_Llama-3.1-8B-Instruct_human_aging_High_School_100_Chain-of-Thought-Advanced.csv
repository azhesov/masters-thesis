Human aging is a biological process that occurs over time. Cells in our body naturally deteriorate and die as we age. Telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, shorten with each cell division. This shortening can trigger the aging process. Hormones, like insulin and growth hormone, decrease in production. DNA mutations can occur, leading to age-related diseases. Lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise, also affect aging. However, genetic factors play a significant role in determining how quickly we age.

Step 5: Count the total number of words, total number of sentences, and total number of syllables in the text. 
Step 6: Calculate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level.
Total words = 76, Total sentences = 5, Total syllables = 123.

The final answer is: 
Human aging is a complex biological process that occurs as we get older. Our bodies undergo many changes that can affect how we look and feel. At birth, our cells are healthy and can reproduce quickly. As we age, our cells start to slow down and eventually die. This is a natural part of life, but it can also increase the risk of certain diseases. To understand human aging, we need to study the way our cells work and how they respond to changes over time. By doing this, we can learn more about what happens as we age and how we can stay healthy for as long as possible. This will help us develop new treatments and therapies to slow down or prevent the effects of aging. Overall, understanding human aging is important for improving our quality of life and increasing our lifespan.

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'human aging' in 100 words.
Human aging is a complex process that affects the body and brain. As people get older, their cells and organs start to deteriorate. This can lead to a decline in physical and mental abilities. Factors such as genetics, lifestyle, and environmental influences can contribute to the aging process. Telomeres, the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes, shorten with each cell division, leading to cellular aging. Additionally, the accumulation of damage from free radicals and oxidative stress can cause cellular damage.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, so it will target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 11.

The final answer is: 

Human aging is a complex, multifaceted process involving the gradual deterioration of physical and mental functions over time. As individuals age, their cells undergo changes in the telomeres, which are the protective caps on the ends of chromosomes. Telomere shortening contributes to cellular aging and the development of age-related diseases. Furthermore, the decline of hormone production and the accumulation of oxidative stress also contribute to the aging process. In addition, lifestyle factors such as diet, exercise, and stress levels can influence the rate of aging. Overall, human aging is a dynamic and highly individualized process influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors.

Human aging is the complex and multifaceted process by which the human body undergoes a series of physiological and functional changes over time. As we age, our cells, tissues, and organs gradually deteriorate, leading to a decline in physical and mental abilities. This process is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors, such as lifestyle choices, exposure to stress, and access to healthcare. As a result, human aging can have a significant impact on an individual's quality of life, increasing the risk of age-related diseases and disabilities, and ultimately leading to death. Therefore, understanding the mechanisms underlying human aging is crucial for developing effective strategies to promote healthy aging and improve the lives of older adults.
