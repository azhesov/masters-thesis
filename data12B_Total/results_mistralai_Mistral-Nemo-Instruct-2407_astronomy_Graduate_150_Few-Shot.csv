Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Astronomy (from the Greek words 'astron' meaning ""star"" and 'nomos' meaning ""law"") is the scientific study of celestial objects (stars, galaxies, planets, and more) and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. Astronomers, using scientific theories and observational data, investigate the physical properties, distribution, motion, and evolution of these objects and phenomena. The term astronomy originated from the ancient Greeks, with early astronomers like Aristotle and Ptolemy making significant contributions. Today, astronomy is a multidisciplinary field, attracting professionals from various backgrounds such as physics, mathematics, and engineering.

Astronomy, derived from the Greek words astron, meaning ""star,"" and nomos, meaning ""law,"" is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere. It involves physics, mathematics, and chemistry to understand the physical and chemical properties of celestial bodies, their interactions, and their evolution over time. Astronomers, like their counterparts in cosmology, strive to explain the universe's origin, evolution, and ultimate fate. Unlike cosmologists, astronomers focus primarily on objects within the universe, such as stars, galaxies, and planets, rather than the universe itself. The term astronomy was first used in English in the late 14th century, making it one of the oldest natural sciences. Today, astronomers use advanced technology like telescopes and satellites to explore the cosmos, pushing the boundaries of human knowledge and understanding.",15.4,34.49,18.6,16.4,17.02,13.93,7.11,18.0

Astronomy (from the Greek astro, ""star"" and nomos, ""laws"") is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. Professional astronomers, using specialized telescopes and equipment, explore the universe's origins, composition, evolution, and ultimate fate. This interdisciplinary field combines physics, mathematics, chemistry, and computer science. The term astronomy was first used in English in the late 14th century. Amateur astronomers also contribute significantly, observing celestial events and phenomena with their own equipment. Both groups share a common goal: to unravel the mysteries of the cosmos and advance our understanding of the universe.",14.6,36.52,17.7,16.3,16.84,14.16,6.88,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'astronomy' targeting the same readability level (Graduate), limited to 150 words. Astronomy (from the Greek 'astros', meaning star, and 'nomos', meaning law) is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside the Earth's atmosphere. Astronomers study objects ranging from planets and stars to galaxies and the entire universe. They use physics and mathematics to understand these celestial bodies and phenomena. Astronomy is one of the oldest sciences, with roots tracing back to ancient civilizations like the Greeks and Babylonians. Today, astronomers use advanced technology like telescopes and satellites to observe and collect data from space. They also explore theoretical aspects, such as the origin and evolution of the universe, and the search for exoplanets.",13.7,44.48,17.5,15.8,16.23,13.58,6.85,18.0

Astronomy (from the Greek astron, ""star"" and nomos, ""law"" or ""science""), is the scientific study of celestial objects (like stars, galaxies, and planets) and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It involves the observation and analysis of electromagnetic radiation and particles from these objects, with the goal of understanding their physical and chemical properties, their evolution, and their interactions. Astronomers, typically trained in physics, mathematics, or a related field, pursue this study to unravel the mysteries of the universe, from the scale of subatomic particles to the vastness of the cosmos.",16.1,32.77,19.2,17.1,18.29,13.88,7.35,18.0
