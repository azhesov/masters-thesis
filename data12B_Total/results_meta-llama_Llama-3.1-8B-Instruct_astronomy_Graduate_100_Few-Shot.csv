Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Astronomy, from the Greek astron, ""star"" and nomos, ""law,"" is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. It is a branch of physics that deals with the study of the physical nature of celestial objects, such as stars, galaxies, and black holes. The study of astronomy has led to numerous groundbreaking discoveries, including the existence of dark matter and dark energy, which have significantly impacted our understanding of the universe. Astronomers use a variety of techniques, including spectroscopy and telescope observations, to study celestial objects and phenomena.

Astronomy is the study of celestial objects, space, and the physical nature of the universe. The word astronomy comes from the Greek words 'astron,' meaning star, and 'nomia,' meaning law. Astronomy has been a human endeavor for thousands of years, with early civilizations tracking the movements of the sun, moon, and stars. Today, astronomers use advanced telescopes and space missions to explore the universe and gain a deeper understanding of its origins, evolution, and fate. This field has led to numerous breakthroughs in physics, mathematics, and our understanding of the cosmos. It is an ever-evolving and constantly advancing discipline.

Astronomy, from the Greek astro, ""star"" and nomos, ""law"" or ""study of"", is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe. The field of astronomy is further divided into branches, such as stellar astronomy, galactic astronomy, and cosmology. By using telescopes and other astronomical instruments, astronomers have been able to study the properties of celestial objects, including their distances, sizes, and motions. The study of astronomy has also led to a greater understanding of the universe's origins and evolution, as well as the search for life beyond Earth. It has greatly impacted our understanding of the cosmos.

Astronomy, the study of celestial objects, space, and phenomena, has been a human endeavor for thousands of years. The discipline has evolved significantly over time, from ancient civilizations' observations of the night sky to modern telescopes and space exploration. Astronomers investigate the universe's structure, evolution, and dynamics, as well as the laws governing its behavior. Theories in astronomy may incorporate both empirical evidence and theoretical frameworks, drawing from various fields, including physics, mathematics, and philosophy. As a multidisciplinary field, astronomy seeks to understand the cosmos, its mysteries, and the secrets hidden within its vast expanse. Its pursuit is driven by curiosity and the quest for knowledge.

Astronomy is the scholarly study of celestial objects, space, and phenomena.

Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Astronomy (from the Greek word astron, ""star"" and nomos, ""law""), is the scientific study of celestial objects, space, and the physical nature of the universe. It includes the study of stars, galaxies, asteroids, comets, and other celestial bodies. Astronomy is a natural science that has been a part of human curiosity and exploration since ancient times. It is a field that seeks to understand the physical laws and principles governing the universe, through a combination of observation, experimentation, and theoretical work.

Astronomy is the study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. It involves the study of the physical properties and behavior of celestial objects and phenomena. This includes the study of stars, galaxies, black holes, and other objects in our solar system and beyond. Astronomers use a variety of methods to study the universe, including telescopes, spacecraft, and other technologies. By understanding the workings of the universe, astronomers can gain insight into the fundamental laws of physics and the history and evolution of the cosmos.

The term astronomy (from the Greek astron, ""star"" and nomos, ""law""), is the study of celestial objects, space, and the physical universe as a whole. The word astronomy was first used in English in 1588, in Thomas Digges's Pick of All the World's Observations. Astronomy is divided into two main branches: observational astronomy and theoretical astronomy. Observational astronomy focuses on the collection and analysis of data from observations of celestial objects, while theoretical astronomy focuses on the development of models and theories to explain these observations. Astronomy is a branch of astrophysics. It is used to understand the behavior, properties, and evolution of celestial objects. It is also used to understand the origins and composition of the universe. It is also used to understand the potential for life in the universe. Astronomy is a highly interdisciplinary field of study. It is a combination of physics, mathematics, and computer science. It also draws upon philosophy, history, and culture.
