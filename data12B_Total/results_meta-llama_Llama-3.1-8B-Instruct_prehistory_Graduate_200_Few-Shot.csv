Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Prehistory (from the Greek pre, ""before"" and historia, ""history""), is the period of human existence before written records. Archaeological findings, oral traditions, and cultural artifacts are used to understand the past and reconstruct the lives of ancient societies. While the term prehistory was not coined until the 19th century, the study of ancient civilizations and cultures has been an ongoing pursuit of scholars, from ancient Greeks to modern-day archaeologists. The field of prehistory is interdisciplinary, drawing upon anthropology, sociology, and history to examine the social, economic, and cultural developments of early human societies. Because of the limitations of written records, theories in prehistory often rely on circumstantial evidence and interpretations of material culture, which can lead to multiple and competing explanations of the past. Despite these challenges, prehistory remains a rich and dynamic field, offering insights into the evolution of human societies and the development of complex cultures. By studying prehistory, scholars can gain a deeper understanding of the human",15.4,34.49,18.7,17.2,17.69,14.1,7.12,18.0

Prehistory (from the Greek πρὶν, ""before"" and ἱστορία, ""story""), is the period of human history that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of written records. This time period is not studied in the same manner as recorded history, as it lacks written documentation, and relies on archaeological evidence and oral traditions. Prehistory is often divided into three sub-periods: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age), each characterized by distinct technological and cultural developments. The study of prehistory involves various disciplines, including archaeology, anthropology, geology, and sociology, and is crucial in understanding the evolution of human societies and cultures. Despite its importance, prehistory remains a subject of ongoing debate and research, with new discoveries and methods continually shedding new light on the lives and experiences of our ancient ancestors.

Prehistory is the period of human history before written records. Archaeologists study the remains and artifacts left behind to reconstruct a picture of the past. This period is often divided into three distinct ages: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic age, also known as the Old Stone Age, dates from the earliest appearance of humans to around 10,000 BCE. It is characterized by the use of stone tools and the development of early societies. The Mesolithic age, also known as the Middle Stone Age, followed the Paleolithic age and is marked by the use of more sophisticated stone tools and the beginning of agriculture. The Neolithic age, also known as the New Stone Age, saw the development of settled agriculture and the emergence of complex societies. The study of prehistory allows us to gain a deeper understanding of human evolution, culture, and technology.

Prehistory is the period of time before recorded history, and as such, it is a realm of study that is often shrouded in mystery. The study of prehistory, which encompasses archaeology, anthropology, and the sciences, is a multidisciplinary field that seeks to understand the lives and cultures of ancient societies. Despite the challenges of reconstructing the past without written records, scholars have been able to piece together a narrative of human evolution and the development of complex societies through the analysis of material culture, such as artifacts, architecture, and the natural environment. The study of prehistory is often divided into distinct periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each of which is characterized by significant technological and social developments. Through the examination of these periods, researchers can gain insights into the ways in which human societies have adapted to their environments, and the ways in which they have developed and evolved over time.

Prehistory (from the Greek pre, ""before"" and historia, ""story"" or ""history"") is the study of human societies prior to the advent of written records. It is often considered the period of human culture before the invention of writing. The period of prehistory varies in length depending on the region, but it typically ranges from the earliest human appearance in the world to the advent of writing. In many regions, the period of prehistory extends from 99,000 years ago to the rise of civilization around 4,000 BCE. The primary sources of prehistory include archaeological finds, oral traditions, and the interpretations of artifacts, which provide clues about the lives and cultures of ancient human societies. The study of prehistory has a significant impact on our understanding of the past, and informs the field of history and related disciplines.

Prehistory, is the period of time before written records exist, as opposed to history which is the study of events which have been recorded. This distinction is not as clear-cut as it might seem, as many prehistoric cultures left behind artifacts and other evidence of their existence, which can be used to reconstruct their lives and cultures. Prehistory is divided into several periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each with its own unique characteristics and developments.
The Paleolithic period is characterized by the use of stone tools and the development of early human societies, while the Mesolithic period saw the introduction of new technologies, such as the bow and arrow, and the expansion of human populations. The Neolithic period is marked by the beginning of agriculture and the development of more complex societies. Prehistory is a vast and complex field of study, with many different cultures and time periods to explore and understand.

Prehistory (from the Greek 'before history', prē, ""before"" and historia, ""story""), is the period of human history before the invention of writing, and therefore the period prior to the advent of recorded history. The period of prehistory is usually divided into several distinct periods, including the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), Neolithic (New Stone Age), and the Chalcolithic (Copper Age). 
The study of prehistory is a significant field of anthropological research. 
It involves the examination of the material remains left behind by past cultures, such as archaeological sites, tools, and other artifacts. 
These remains can provide valuable information about the lives of ancient people and the societies they lived in. 
Through the analysis of these remains, researchers can reconstruct a picture of what life was like during the prehistoric period, and gain a deeper understanding of human evolution and the development of human societies.

Prehistory (from the Greek πρῶτος, ""before"" and ἱστορία, ""history"") is the study of the period before written records. This period spans from the earliest human life to the advent of writing, a time span that varies in length depending on the region and culture. The study of prehistory, therefore, relies on the interpretation of archaeological evidence, such as artifacts, oral traditions, and environmental data. The period of prehistory is often divided into several distinct phases, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic, each characterized by distinct technological and cultural developments. The study of prehistory has been greatly influenced by the work of Charles Lyell, who in the early 19th century first proposed that the Earth's surface had undergone significant changes in the past. Furthermore, the concept of the ""four stages of human progress,"" first articulated by the French philosopher Auguste Comte, has also played a significant role in shaping the study of prehistory",15.9,33.38,18.7,16.8,17.62,13.76,7.16,18.0

Prehistory, is the period of time before written records. It is a time period that is still not fully understood, but is studied by archaeologists, anthropologists, and historians. The study of prehistory is based on the analysis of artifacts, such as tools, pottery, and other objects, that were left behind by early humans. These artifacts provide clues about the way of life, culture, and technology of early humans. The study of prehistory is also based on the analysis of fossil records and other geological evidence. 
Prehistory is divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic period is characterized by the use of stone tools, while the Mesolithic period is characterized by the use of more sophisticated tools made of stone and bone. The Neolithic period is characterized by the use of metal tools and the development of settled agriculture. The study of prehistory is an ongoing process, and new discoveries are continually being made. As a result",13.9,38.35,15.7,15.7,15.49,12.89,6.32,18.0

Prehistory, the period before written records, is the study of the past, with a focus on the human and animal species that inhabited the Earth before the advent of written communication. The discipline is a multidisciplinary field that incorporates archaeology, anthropology, geology, and biology to understand the cultures, societies, and environments of ancient civilizations. 
Prehistory is a vast and complex subject that encompasses many aspects of human life, including technology, economy, politics, and social organization. It is a field that has seen significant developments in recent years, with advances in methods and techniques, such as radiocarbon dating and genetic analysis, which have greatly expanded our knowledge of the past. The study of prehistory has also been influenced by new discoveries, such as the discovery of ancient DNA and the analysis of ancient artifacts. Overall, prehistory is a rich and dynamic field that continues to evolve and expand our understanding of human history and the natural world.
