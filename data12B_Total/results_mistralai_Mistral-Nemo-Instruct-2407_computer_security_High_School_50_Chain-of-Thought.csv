""Imagine a castle protecting a kingdom. Computer security does the same, guarding digital kingdoms. It's like setting passwords, updating software, and installing firewalls. These are like strong walls, towers, and wise guards. They stop hackers, who are like attackers trying to sneak in. Just as a good king cares for his castle, you should care for your computer's security.""",6.4,68.87,8.5,9.4,8.4,10.13,4.35,5.0

**Final Draft:**
Computer security is like protecting your house from intruders. Just as you lock your doors and windows, a computer uses passwords and firewalls to keep unwanted guests out. It's also important to keep your computer's software up-to-date, like fixing broken locks or adding new security cameras. This helps protect your personal information, which is like your valuables at home.",7.0,67.25,8.6,10.6,9.35,9.67,4.54,5.888888888888889
