Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Use the words 'era', 'human', 'tool', 'emergence', 'hunter-gatherer','society', and'survival'.

The prehistory era, spanning from the emergence of tool-wielding humans to the advent of recorded history, is a fascinating period in human evolution. This era was characterized by the dominance of hunter-gatherer societies, where survival depended on the mastery of rudimentary tools and the exploitation of natural resources. The tools they created, such as stone axes and spears, were not merely objects of utility but also symbols of their societal progress.",10.9,46.37,13.7,13.5,14.21,13.57,6.22,10.142857142857142

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Prehistory, as a term, refers to the span of time before written records, often designated by archaeological periods. It begins with the emergence of hominids, around 6 million years ago, and ends with the advent of literacy, roughly 3,300 BCE. This era is characterized by stone tool use, migration, and societal evolution, marked by significant cultural shifts like the advent of agriculture.",9.6,55.03,11.5,12.5,13.08,11.77,5.25,10.75

The term 'prehistory' refers to the period before written history, encompassing the Stone Age, when humans were hunter-gatherers and had not yet developed agriculture or complex technologies. Prehistoric societies were characterized by their use of stone tools, their nomadic lifestyles, and their dependence on natural resources. Despite the lack of written records, we can infer aspects of prehistoric culture, such as art and religion, from archaeological evidence. The transition from prehistory to civilization marked a significant shift in human society, as humans began to develop agriculture, more advanced technologies, and complex social structures. This shift was gradual and varied across different regions, reflecting the diverse cultures and languages that emerged during this period.",12.9,35.68,16.7,15.6,14.15,16.71,5.98,12.833333333333334
