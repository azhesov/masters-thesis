Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?""

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

In prehistory, people lived long ago. They lived before there were written words. There were no books or newspapers. So, we don’t have stories about them. But we know some things. We can see their paintings. They painted on walls in caves. We can see tools they made. They made tools from stone. They hunted animals. They ate the meat. They also ate plants. They gathered fruits and nuts. They lived in small groups. They moved around. They followed animals they hunted. Prehistory ended a long time ago.

Prehistory is a time long ago when people lived without books or writing. They did not have phones or computers. People used tools made of stone. They hunted for food and lived in caves or simple homes. They did not know how to write their stories. So, we cannot read about their lives. We learn about prehistory by looking at old tools, paintings, and bones. These are like clues that help us understand how people lived a very long time ago.",1.7,97.3,2.0,6.6,4.38,3.03,2.52,2.1875

A long time ago, people lived on Earth. They didn't have cars or computers. They made tools with stones. These tools helped them hunt animals and gather food. They used stones to cut meat and to make fires. People lived in groups, like families. They shared their tools and food. They learned how to make new tools from each other. This is called prehistory.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. Prehistory is a time before there was any written history. People lived in caves and hunted animals for food. They made tools from stones. They did not have cars or computers. They used their hands and feet to move around. They lived in small groups. They made pictures on cave walls. These pictures showed animals and their lives. These pictures are the only way we know about prehistory. They are very old and we can't ask the people who made them. Scientists study these pictures to learn about this time.",1.6,97.5,2.0,6.5,4.38,3.09,2.46,2.1875

Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?"" But the owl says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose. Maybe it is her egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, ""Is this your egg?"" But the goose says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the two ducks. Maybe it is their egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the two ducks. They ask the two ducks, ""Is this your egg?"" But the two ducks say, ""No, that is not our egg."" Then the egg breaks.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. Prehistory is a long time ago before people wrote books. Before writing, people painted pictures on cave walls to tell stories. In prehistory, people lived in caves and hunted animals for food. They used stones and wood to make tools. They walked and traveled long distances. They lived close to nature and the animals.",1.6,97.5,1.9,6.4,4.31,2.97,2.55,2.1875

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. Prehistory is the period before written records began. Archaeologists study this time by finding and studying old tools, art, and buildings.

In old times, before people could write, there was a time called prehistory. Archaeologists walk in places where old people lived long ago. They look for old tools, like stone knives. They find art on cave walls, like pictures of animals. They also find old buildings, like big stones that people put together. These things help us know what life was like before we had books.",1.7,97.2,2.4,6.6,4.51,3.62,2.55,2.1875
