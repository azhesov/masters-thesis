Human aging is like when a plant grows from a tiny seed into a big tree. At first, you're small, like a baby. Then, you grow bigger and stronger, like a child or teenager. After that, you become an adult, with a job and a family. But as time goes on, you start to slow down, like an old car. Your hair turns gray, and you might need glasses to see. This is because your body works a little bit harder to do the same things. But don't worry, you still have lots of energy to play and learn new things!",4.5,84.37,5.2,7.8,6.54,5.84,3.62,5.333333333333333

Aging is when people grow older. This happens slowly over many years. When we are young, we have lots of energy and can do many things. But as we get older, we might move slower and have less energy. Our skin may get wrinkles, and our hair might turn gray or fall out. This is all part of growing older, or aging.",5.3,76.93,4.9,7.4,6.09,5.95,3.7,5.111111111111111

Paragraph:

Aging is like when you grow up. You start as a baby, then you become a kid, then a teenager, and finally, you're an adult. But unlike growing up, aging doesn't stop at adulthood. It keeps going until you're really old, with wrinkles and gray hair. This happens because our body's cells get tired and stop working as well. They can't make new cells as fast as before, so we start to slow down and get old. That's human aging!",5.4,76.72,6.4,7.7,5.55,7.29,3.68,5.333333333333333

Human aging is like a plant growing. Just like a tiny seed grows into a tall tree, a baby grows into an adult. As people grow older, their bodies change. They get wrinkles on their face and gray hair. They might need glasses to see better. They also need more time to do things, like running or learning new things. They may not be able to do everything they used to do. But, even with these changes, they can still have fun and enjoy life.",3.9,86.1,5.1,6.8,5.5,6.59,3.48,4.4
