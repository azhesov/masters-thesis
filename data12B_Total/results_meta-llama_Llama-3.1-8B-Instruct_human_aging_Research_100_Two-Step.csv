Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. Here's a summary:
Human aging is a complex, multifaceted process that involves the gradual deterioration of physical, mental, and biological functions. As people age, their bodies undergo various changes, including cellular senescence, epigenetic modifications, and telomere shortening. This leads to increased susceptibility to age-related diseases, such as cancer, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Lifestyle factors, genetics, and environmental influences also play a significant role in shaping the aging process. Despite advances in medical technology and increased life expectancy, human aging remains a significant challenge, with many unanswered questions about its underlying mechanisms and potential interventions to promote healthy aging.
