""Computer security, also known as cybersecurity, is a multifaceted domain that safeguards digital assets from unauthorized access, use, disruption, or destruction. It encompasses various aspects, including cryptography, which employs mathematical algorithms to secure communication and data storage. Intrusion detection systems, a vital component of computer security, monitor networks for suspicious activities, alerting administrators to potential threats. Firewalls, another key defensive measure, regulate network traffic, preventing malicious software from infiltrating systems. Additionally, secure protocols such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS) ensure the confidentiality and integrity of data transmitted over the internet. Lastly, secure coding practices, which involve writing code that is resistant to attacks, are essential for preventing vulnerabilities that can be exploited by cybercriminals.""",15.7,12.22,17.0,15.8,17.22,18.15,7.11,11.142857142857142

Computer security, at the Research level, is the protection of data and systems from unauthorized access, use, disruption, or destruction. Imagine a library (the system) containing valuable books (data). Researchers (authorized users) need to access these books to perform their studies, but they must follow specific rules and use designated tools (protocols and software) to do so. Now, consider someone trying to enter the library without permission, or altering the books without consent. This is analogous to a cyber attack, where malicious actors (hackers) attempt to infiltrate computer systems to steal, modify, or damage data. To prevent such incidents, computer security employs various strategies, including encryption (locking the books in a safe), firewalls (library guards checking IDs), and intrusion detection systems (security cameras monitoring the library). These measures aim to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information, much like how a well-sec",12.5,36.79,14.6,14.0,14.25,14.44,6.21,8.571428571428571
