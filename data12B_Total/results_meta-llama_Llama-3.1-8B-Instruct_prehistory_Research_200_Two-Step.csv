**Prehistory: A Summary**

Prehistory is the period preceding the advent of written records, spanning from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. This epoch is typically categorized into three stages: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic stage, dating back to approximately 2.5 million years ago, is characterized by the development of stone tools and the emergence of early human species. The Mesolithic stage, which began around 10,000 years ago, is marked by the refinement of tools and the expansion of human populations. The Neolithic stage, which also began around 10,000 years ago, is distinguished by the domestication of plants and animals, the establishment of settled agriculture, and the emergence of complex societies.

Prehistory is a term used to describe the period of time before recorded history, which spans from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing. During this time, humans lived in small groups, often as hunter-gatherers, relying on the natural environment for food and shelter. As societies grew, they developed more complex cultures, including art, language, and tools. The invention of tools, such as stone knives and spear points, marked significant milestones in human development. The introduction of agriculture around 10,000 years ago led to the formation of settled communities, which in turn gave rise to more complex societies and the development of writing.

Prehistory is the temporally unrecorded epoch of human existence, spanning from the emergence of the first hominids to the advent of written records. This vast expanse of time witnessed the transformation of early hominids into anatomically modern humans, and the evolution of societies from nomadic, hunter-gatherer groups to complex, agrarian civilizations. Prehistory is conventionally partitioned into three distinct stages: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. The Paleolithic era saw the emergence of early human species, such as Homo erectus, and the development of rudimentary tools.
