The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Astronomy is the study of the sky and the things in the sky. The Sun, the Moon, the stars, and the planets are all things in the sky that astronomers study. They look at these things with telescopes. Astronomers want to know how they work and what they are made of. They want to know if there is other life in the sky. They use special computers to help them study the sky. They can look at pictures of the sky from far away. Astronomers are like detectives. They search for clues in the sky to learn more about it.  They want to answer the question, ""What is the sky?""

Astronomy is a subject we learn about. We learn about the stars in the sky. The stars are very far away. We learn about the Sun, the Moon, and the planets. They all have their own paths to follow. Sometimes we can see the stars, sometimes we can’t. The stars shine when the light gets to us. The stars are far away. We can see the stars at night. We can also see the stars in the morning. But we have to look very hard. We need to use special tools like binoculars to see them. That is why we study astronomy. We want to learn about the stars. We want to know more about them. We want to learn about the whole universe. We want to know what is out there. That is why we learn about astronomy.  (This example has a lot of extra information and is a bit too long.

Astronomy is the study of the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets. We can see the Sun, Moon, and stars in the sky at night. The Sun is a big ball of fire in the sky. The Moon is a big rock that goes around the Earth. The stars are tiny lights that shine in the sky. The planets are big rocks that go around the Sun. Astronomers study the Sun, Moon, stars, and planets. They use big telescopes to look at them. They want to know how they were made and how they work. Astronomers also want to know if there are other planets with life on them. They are still learning about the universe.

3. Introduce a character and their actions.
4. Describe the character's actions and the outcome.
5. Provide a conclusion or a 'take-home message'.

Example Paragraph:
Astronomy is the study of stars and planets. What would happen if a planet had a ring? Let's see what happens in a small town called Starville. One day, a curious kid named Timmy looked up at the sky. He saw a planet with a ring, and he wanted to know more. Timmy built a model of the planet and put it under a lamp. After a few minutes, the ring started to glow. Timmy was amazed! He learned that the ring was made of ice and was reflecting the light from the lamp. Timmy was thrilled to discover something new in the field of astronomy.  (100 words)

Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'astronomy' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 100 words. 

Astronomy is the study of the stars. People have always looked up at the stars and wondered about them. Scientists study the stars to learn more about them. They use special tools like telescopes to look at the stars. The stars are very far away. They shine because they are hot. Some stars are big and some are small. The sun is a star. It shines on the Earth and makes it warm. Scientists also study the planets. The planets go around the stars. The Earth is a planet. It goes around the sun. We can see the sun and the planets in the sky. They are all very interesting. 





Answer: 
The stars are like tiny balls of fire in the sky. They shine because they are very hot. The stars are very far away from us. Some stars are big and some are small. We can see the stars at night.

Astronomy is a subject that studies the sky. The sky is full of things we can’t see. We need telescopes to see them. Astronomers use telescopes to study the stars, planets, and the Sun. They also study the Moon. The Moon goes through phases. That means it looks different at different times. Sometimes the Moon is big and bright. Sometimes it is small and dim. We can see the Moon at night. The Moon is in the sky. The Sun is in the sky too. But we can’t see the Sun at night. It is too bright. We can see it in the daytime. The Sun is very hot. It makes our planet warm.

Astronomy is the study of the universe. It is fun to learn about the stars, planets, and galaxies. You can see the stars at night. You can look at pictures of the planets. You can even go to a planetarium and see stars and planets up close. The stars and planets look different at different times. The stars are like diamonds in the sky. The planets look like big balls. The galaxies are like huge swirly clouds. There are many galaxies in the universe. Astronomers study the stars, planets, and galaxies. They try to learn more about the universe.
