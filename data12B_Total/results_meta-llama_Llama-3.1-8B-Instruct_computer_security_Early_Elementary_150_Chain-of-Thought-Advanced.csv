Here is the step-by-step solution to the problem:
Step 1: Think about how to explain 'computer security' in 150 words.

Computer security means keeping computers safe from bad people who want to harm them. Bad people can try to break into computers to steal things or cause trouble. We use special tools and methods to stop them. These tools help keep our computers from getting sick or hurt. We also use passwords to keep our computers locked and only let the right people in.

Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, so it will target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 2.

Here's an updated paragraph with simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences:

Here is the explanation of how to explain 'computer security' in 150 words, targeting Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 2.

The computer is a machine that does work. It can talk to other machines. But, it can also get hurt. That is why we have something called computer security. It is like a lock on a door. It keeps bad things from getting in. We need to make sure that the lock is strong. We need to make sure that only good things get in. We need to keep the computer safe. We can do that by using a password. A password is like a secret code. It keeps people from getting in who are not supposed to get in. We need to keep our password secret. We need to make sure that it is hard to guess. We need to keep our computer safe by being careful. We need to be careful about what",4.5,79.16,4.3,8.1,5.5,5.71,3.0,5.2
