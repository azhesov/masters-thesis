Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Nutrition (from the Latin nutrire, ""to nourish""), is the process of providing and utilizing nutrients to maintain life. Physical nutrition, studied by biologists, physicians, and dietitians, involves the scientific understanding of how organisms derive energy and grow from their food. The term nutrition was first used in English in 1661, by Thomas Browne in his ""Pseudoxia Epidemica."" A balanced, nutritional diet is essential for human health, providing vital nutrients like proteins, vitamins, and minerals.",15.0,35.51,17.8,16.6,17.0,13.52,6.99,18.0

Nutrition, derived from the Latin 'nutrire', meaning 'to nurture', is the study of food and drink, their chemical composition, and how they provide energy and nutrients to sustain life. This multifaceted discipline, explored by scientists like biochemists, dietitians, and nutritionists, delves into the interactions between nutrients and the human body, influencing health and well-being. Nutrition science is also intertwined with philosophy, questioning ethical implications and societal impacts of food choices.

Nutrition, from the Latin 'nutritio,' is the study of food and drink, their chemical composition, and how they fuel and maintain the body. Physical nutrition, a branch of the broader field, is studied by scientists like nutritionists, biochemists, and dietitians, who explore how food and drink impact health and disease. The term nutrition first appeared in English in the 17th century, with 'nutritive' used to describe the sustenance provided by food. Today, understanding nutrition is crucial for addressing global health challenges, from malnutrition to obesity.",14.4,42.45,18.4,16.6,17.47,13.65,7.15,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

Nutrition, derived from the Latin 'nutrire', meaning 'to nourish', is the study of food and its impact on health. This scientific discipline, like physical cosmology, attracts diverse scholars such as dietitians, biochemists, and even social scientists. It delves into the complex interplay of nutrients and their absorption, the impact of diet on health and disease, and the cultural and socio-economic factors shaping food choices. Yet, similar to physical cosmology, nutrition theory may incorporate untestable assumptions and depend on philosophical interpretations, reflecting its interdisciplinary nature.",15.6,33.99,18.8,16.9,17.57,13.99,7.31,18.0

Nutrition, from the Latin 'nutrire', meaning 'to nourish', is the study of how organisms take in and use food to sustain life. It encompasses the study of nutrients, their sources, and how they affect health. Nutrition science is a multidisciplinary field, drawing from biology, biochemistry, and physiology. It examines how foods and beverages provide energy and essential components for growth, repair, and function.",13.9,43.77,17.6,16.2,17.16,13.23,7.01,18.0
