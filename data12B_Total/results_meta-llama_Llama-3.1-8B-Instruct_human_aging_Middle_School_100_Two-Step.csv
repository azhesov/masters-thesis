Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. 
Human aging refers to the process of gradual deterioration and loss of physical, cognitive, and functional capabilities that occurs as people grow older. It is a complex and multifaceted phenomenon that affects all aspects of life, including health, appearance, and social relationships. Aging is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise, and stress. As people age, they experience changes in their bodies, such as decreased muscle mass, bone density, and sensory capabilities, which can lead to increased risk of age-related diseases, such as cardiovascular disease, cancer, and dementia. Understanding aging can help develop strategies to promote healthy aging and improve quality of life.

Human aging is a natural process that affects our bodies over time. It's influenced by our genes, lifestyle, and environment. As we age, our cells get damaged and can't repair themselves as well. This leads to changes in our body's systems, making us weaker and more prone to diseases. Our brains and immune systems also slow down, making it harder to fight off sicknesses. Understanding human aging helps us develop ways to stay healthy and prevent age-related problems. It's a big topic that combines biology, medicine, and psychology.

Human aging is a natural process that happens to everyone. As we get older, our bodies start to change. Our cells, DNA, and organs work less well. This can cause problems like cancer, heart disease, and memory loss. Scientists are still learning about human aging. They want to find ways to keep people healthy and active as they get older. This is important because age-related diseases can be very serious. By understanding human aging, we can develop ways to prevent or delay these diseases.

Aging is a complex and multifaceted process influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. Here are the main factors that contribute to the aging process:

1.  **Genetic factors**: Our genetic makeup plays a significant role in determining how we age. Genetic factors can influence the rate at which our cells age, the likelihood of developing age-related diseases, and the effectiveness of our body's repair mechanisms.
2.  **Environmental factors**: Exposure to environmental stressors such as pollution, UV radiation, and toxins can accelerate aging. Environmental factors can also affect our lifestyle choices, such as diet and exercise habits.
3.  **Lifestyle factors**: Our lifestyle choices, such as diet, exercise, smoking, and stress levels, can significantly impact the aging process. A poor diet, lack of exercise, and chronic stress can accelerate aging, while a healthy lifestyle can help slow it down.
4.  **Cellular damage**: As we age, our cells' ability to divide and repair deteriorates, leading to an accumulation of cellular damage. This damage can be caused by genetic mutations,",11.9,38.21,13.3,13.3,10.92,13.57,4.84,11.333333333333334
