Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Prehistory is the era before written history began, spanning from the dawn of humanity until the advent of record-keeping. This period, devoid of documented accounts, is reconstructed through archaeology and anthropology. Archaeologists, detectives of the past, uncover artifacts and structures that serve as silent witnesses to ancient cultures and civilizations. Anthropologists, meanwhile, study contemporary non-literate societies to gain insights into prehistory. Together, they piece together a picture of our distant ancestors, their technologies, social structures, and cultural practices, providing a glimpse into the human story before the written word.",13.3,39.97,15.8,15.6,14.65,14.05,6.19,17.75

Prehistory is the period of human history before written records, usually divided into three stages: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age.

Prehistory, the era preceding written records, is typically segmented into three stages based on the dominant material used for tools and weapons. The Stone Age, the earliest period, spanned from the first use of stone tools around 3.3 million years ago to the advent of metalworking. During this era, humans primarily relied on stone implements for hunting, gathering, and crafting. The Bronze Age followed, marked by the discovery of copper and tin smelting around 3300 BCE in Mesopotamia. This period was characterized by the use of bronze tools and weapons, which were stronger and more durable than stone, allowing for advancements in agriculture and warfare. The Iron Age commenced around 1200 BCE with the widespread use of iron tools and weapons, further revolutionizing society with enhanced tools and improved construction methods.

Prehistory is the vast stretch of time before humans began recording their history in writing. During this period, humans did not keep written records, relying instead on oral traditions and material culture to pass down knowledge. Prehistoric societies ranged from nomadic hunter-gatherer groups to complex civilizations, with varying levels of technological development and social organization. Despite the lack of written accounts, archaeologists study this era through artifacts, architecture, and other physical remains, shedding light on human evolution and early cultures.",13.7,38.96,15.9,15.4,14.74,13.7,6.3,17.75

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Prehistory refers to the period before written records began, before the invention of writing. This means that direct information about prehistory comes primarily from archaeological investigations.

Prehistory is the time period before written records began, preceding the invention of writing. This means that our understanding of this era relies heavily on archaeological discoveries. Prehistoric people, lacking a written language, communicated through art, tools, and structures they created. Archaeologists study these artifacts and remnants to reconstruct their cultures, technologies, and ways of life. By examining stone tools, pottery shards, and even ancient DNA, they can piece together a picture of how early humans interacted with their environment and each other. This exploration of the past helps us understand our own history and the journey of human civilization.",13.0,40.89,15.1,15.2,14.13,13.58,5.89,17.75

Prehistory refers to the period of time before written records were kept by humans. It covers the time from the emergence of the earliest Homo sapiens (modern humans) around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing around 3400 BCE in Mesopotamia. Prehistory can be further divided into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, based on the primary tools and weapons used by humans during each period.

Prehistory, the era preceding written records, stretches from the dawn of modern humans around 300,000 years ago to the advent of writing in Mesopotamia circa 3400 BCE. This vast span is often segmented into the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, reflecting the dominant materials humans harnessed for tools and weapons during each phase. Prehistory's absence of written accounts necessitates its study through archaeological artifacts and cultural remnants, providing a window into our ancestors' lives and societal developments.",13.2,45.8,16.0,15.3,15.04,12.83,6.3,17.75
