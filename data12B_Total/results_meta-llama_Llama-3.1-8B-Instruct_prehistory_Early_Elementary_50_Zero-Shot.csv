Here's an updated paragraph:

A long time ago, before people wrote things down, our ancestors lived. This time is called prehistory. We can't read their stories, but we find clues like old tools, houses, and pictures. These clues help us understand how they lived and what they did. It's like a fun puzzle!

Prehistory was a long, long time ago. It was before people wrote down stories. Ancient people lived in caves, hunted for food, and made tools from rocks and sticks.
