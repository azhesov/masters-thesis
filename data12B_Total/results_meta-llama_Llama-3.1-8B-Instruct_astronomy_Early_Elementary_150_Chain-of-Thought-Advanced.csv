The final answer is: 
We look up at the sky. The sky is big. We can see many things in the sky. We see big balls of fire. These are the sun and the moon. The sun is hot. The moon is cool. We can see stars at night. They are far away. Astronomy is when we look at the sky and learn about the things we see. It is fun to learn about the things in the sky. We can learn about planets, comets, and more. We can even learn about the people who look at the sky and learn new things. We can be those people and look at the sky and learn. Astronomy is fun and cool. It helps us learn about the world and the universe. We can learn new things every day. It is like a big adventure",3.2,87.92,2.9,6.8,4.7,4.14,2.77,5.444444444444445

Step 4: Follow your plan and write the final paragraph. I want to be able to explain to a 2nd grade child what astronomy is.  Astronomy is the science that helps us understand the universe. The universe is everything around us. It is the Earth, the Sun, the Moon, the stars, and the galaxies. We can see some of them. We can't see the others. Astronomers use special tools to help them see. They have telescopes that can see really far away. They can see planets, comets, and meteors. They even have spacecraft that can go to other planets and take pictures. By studying the universe, we can learn about how it began and how it will end. It's a very big and exciting job.

Astronomers want to know about stars. They want to know how big stars are, how hot stars are, and how far away stars are. They also want to know if there are other stars like our sun. Astronomers work very hard to learn about stars. They use computers to help them. They also go to special places to look at stars at night. Some astronomers are very smart. They can even find new stars that nobody has seen before. It is fun to learn about stars. We can learn about the world and the universe by looking at stars.""
