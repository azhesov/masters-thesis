As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.

She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Prehistory was the time before written records existed. It spanned millions of years, and our ancestors went through many changes. Humans lived in small groups, hunted, and gathered food. As they moved to new places, their way of life changed. They discovered new tools and learned to control fire. This period ended with the invention of writing, around 5,000 years ago. By studying the artifacts they left behind, like tools and cave paintings, we can learn about the people of prehistory and how they lived. Their stories are a key part of our shared human history.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 100 words. 

Prehistory is the time before written records. It is the period of time before humans were able to write. For many years, people were able to learn and teach others through stories and oral traditions. This way of learning is still used today, but in prehistory, it was the main way of sharing ideas and experiences. Prehistoric humans lived in small groups, hunted for food, and made their own tools. They also created art and shelter. These early humans were able to survive and thrive in their environments, paving the way for future civilizations.

Here is a simple example of what you could write:
 
Prehistory started millions and millions of years ago. It was the time of the dinosaurs. They roamed the earth and were the biggest creatures alive. During prehistory, early humans also lived. They made tools to help them survive. One of the earliest tools was a hammer. The hammer was made from a rock. These early humans lived in caves. They hunted animals for food and protected themselves from the elements. They didn't write or keep records, so we know about their lives through discoveries of their tools and other artifacts.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 100 words.  Prehistory is a period of time before written records existed, so it's a little tricky to write about. Here is a short paragraph that uses vocabulary and structure from the examples:

Before written records existed, people began to notice that plants and animals changed over time. They saw how the seasons came and went, and how the earth was covered with layers of rock and soil. People were curious and wanted to learn more, so they began to ask questions. They observed the way the stars moved in the sky, and how the moon changed shape. By asking questions, they started to stand out, and eventually, they began to piece together a picture of the past. It's a story of how humans first learned about the world around them.

Prehistory is a time period that comes before written records. Before people wrote, they left behind other signs, like tools and art. These signs tell us about life long ago. We can study these signs to learn about how early people lived. Many tools were made from stones and bones. We can tell how people hunted and gathered food by looking at the tools they left behind. By studying these signs, we can imagine what life was like for people before they started writing. We can learn a lot about the past this way.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 100 words. 
Prehistory is a word that refers to a time when humans did not write anything down. People back then were very skilled at making tools from stones and bones. They were also good at hunting and gathering food. In the cold climates, people built homes out of ice and snow. As the years passed, people started to live together in communities. They built shelters and shared food. People from different communities met and traded goods, like stones and furs. They started to tell stories and pass on traditions from one generation to the next. This marked the beginning of human history.  The paragraph is written with simple vocabulary and structure that targets the readability level of upper elementary students. The vocabulary is easy to understand, and the sentences are short and clear. The structure is logical and easy to follow, with each sentence building on the previous one to create a cohesive narrative.

She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 100 words. 

Prehistory was a long time ago, before writing was invented. During this time, people lived in small groups and made tools by hand. As time went on, these tools became more complex. People began to live in larger groups and built shelters. They also started to grow their own food, like corn and barley. The early people were skilled hunters and gatherers, and they had a deep understanding of nature. They left behind clues, like cave paintings and fossils, which help us learn about their lives today. These clues tell us about the 'hows' and 'whys' of prehistory.",6.8,73.07,8.0,9.2,8.35,8.0,4.11,7.142857142857142

The prehistoric era was a time of wonder and discovery. Humans were learning to make tools and weapons to survive in the world. These early humans were hunter-gatherers, living in small tribes and following the seasons. As they moved from place to place, they developed skills and knowledge about the land and its creatures. They were skilled at tracking and hunting large animals like mammoths and saber-toothed tigers. The early humans had to be resourceful and clever to stay alive, and their discoveries paved the way for the civilizations that followed. They were truly remarkable people. 1

Prehistory was a time when humans did not yet have writing. The people of this time were hunters and gatherers. They used stone tools to hunt animals and make food. They wore animal skins and furs to keep warm. They made simple homes from sticks and mud. The people were very good at working together and sharing food. They left behind many clues about their lives. These clues were stone tools, bones, and cave paintings. They tell us about their daily lives and the ways they hunted and gathered food.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 100 words. Prehistory is a term used to describe the period before written records, but in this paragraph, we'll define it in a more narrative way.
During prehistory, humans first appeared on Earth. They were hunter-gatherers, traveling in small groups in search of food. These early humans used stones and sticks to hunt animals and gather fruits and berries. They made homes from animal hides and branches. They had no written language, so they passed down their knowledge and stories through songs, dances, and drawings on cave walls. Over time, they learned new skills, and their societies grew. They began to trade with one another and build more complex homes.  This is how prehistory came to an end.  Prehistory was a time of discovery and growth.  Our ancestors were resourceful and determined.  They paved the way for the societies that followed.  We can still learn from their examples today.  We can learn about their ways of life, their struggles, and their achievements.",6.5,73.88,8.1,9.6,8.29,8.58,4.03,7.142857142857142
