When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Prehistory was a time long ago, when humans first appeared on earth. During this time, humans did not write down their history. Instead, they passed it down through stories and paintings on the walls of caves. This is why we have to be very careful when studying prehistory - we have to use our imagination and think like the people who lived during that time. Imagine that you are a young hunter, living in a small village. You have to be brave and resourceful, because you have to protect your family from the dangers of the wild. You have to know how to make tools and build shelters, and how to find food in the forest. This is what life was like for people during prehistory. We can learn about this time by studying the things they left behind, like the tools they used and the paintings they made on the walls of caves. By studying prehistory, we can get a glimpse of what life was like for our ancestors.

Prehistory is the time before written records began. It's a time when humans were hunter-gatherers. People would follow large animals like mammoths and gather fruits, nuts, and berries. They also fished and hunted for small animals like rabbits. The people of prehistory were highly skilled. They could make tools from stones and wood. They built shelters to protect themselves from the weather and made clothes to keep warm. People also learned how to farm. They discovered how to plant seeds, which led to the growth of cities and eventually, civilizations. As they learned and grew, they were able to create better tools and homes. They were able to live in one place for a long time, which allowed them to create more complex societies. The people of prehistory were able to survive and thrive in many different environments.

During prehistory, humans did not yet have written records. There were no books, no newspapers, and no written messages. People told stories through art, like paintings on cave walls. These images helped to pass down history and traditions from one generation to another. Archaeologists study the artifacts left behind by our ancestors, like tools, bones, and pottery. These relics reveal the lives of early humans, how they lived, what they ate, and how they hunted. The artifacts also show how humans developed and changed over time. By piecing together the evidence, archaeologists can reconstruct the past and learn about the people who lived before us. For example, they have discovered ancient tools made of stone, like hammers and knives, and even early forms of writing, like hieroglyphics. These findings have helped us understand the earliest chapters of human history. By studying the past, we can learn more about ourselves and our place in the world.

The ""hows"" and ""whys"" of prehistory are still largely unknown, but people are trying to figure them out. By studying fossils and artifacts, scientists have been able to make educated guesses about what life was like long ago. For example, the discovery of dinosaur fossils has helped scientists understand the massive creatures that once roamed the Earth. The ""why nots"" of prehistory are even more puzzling - why did some of these creatures go extinct, and why did others evolve into new species? To find the answers, scientists are working together, asking questions, and exploring new ideas. They are also learning from each other, just like Johnson, who learned from the men on her team. By sharing their discoveries and insights, scientists are piecing together the story of prehistory, one small puzzle piece at a time. This is an exciting and ongoing journey of discovery that will continue to reveal the secrets of the past.  (Note: The text is not meant to",7.4,71.55,9.1,10.3,8.98,8.81,4.43,7.142857142857142

Prehistory was a long, long time ago. People during this time didn't leave behind many written records. That's why it's called ""prehistory."" However, archaeologists have discovered many other clues that help us learn about the people who lived then. They've found tools, weapons, and other objects that were made by hand. By studying these objects, we can figure out what life was like for our ancestors. For example, we can tell what they ate by looking at the bones they left behind. We can also see how they built their homes and what kinds of clothes they wore. By piecing together all these clues, we can get a picture of what life was like in prehistory. People were likely very skilled at making things and living off the land. They were also very resourceful, using materials they found in nature to create the tools they needed. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the people who came before us and how they lived.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 200 words.  Prehistory is the period of human history before written records were kept. Before prehistory, there was no written history. The first human civilizations appeared in the Middle East around 4000 BCE. One of the most famous civilizations of prehistory is the Sumerians, who built the first cities and developed writing. 

Prehistory is a time long, long ago when humans didn't keep records. They didn't write down what they did, so we can't know much about what happened. But we can guess some things. People started living in groups and building houses, around 4000 years ago. This is when the first cities were built. We call these people the Sumerians. They are famous for building cities and developing writing. Without writing, we wouldn't have much to learn from, so the Sumerians were very important.

Prehistory is a time before history was recorded. Many discoveries have been made to uncover the lives of people who lived before written records existed. Fossils of early humans and animals were found in rocks and caves. These discoveries helped us learn how ancient people lived, what they ate, and how they dressed. We found tools that early humans used to survive. We also discovered ancient paintings on cave walls and rocks, which showed how people expressed themselves. The study of prehistory has given us a glimpse into the lives of people who came before us, revealing their cultures, traditions, and ways of life. It is a time that is still being studied and learned about today, and it continues to help us understand our place in the world and how we evolved to be who we are today. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the past and appreciate the present.",7.3,71.85,8.7,9.9,9.05,8.47,4.33,7.142857142857142

Prehistory was a long time ago. People lived, but there were no written records of their lives. They did not write down their thoughts or stories. However, archaeologists have found many clues to tell us what people were like during that time. They dug up old bones and discovered tools made from stone and wood. Some tools were for hunting, while others were for making clothes. Archaeologists also found remains of old homes and tools used for farming. They even found the remains of old animals, like mammoths, that people hunted for food. By looking at these clues, we can piece together what life was like for people during prehistory. We know that people had to work hard to survive, and they had to adapt to their surroundings to find food and shelter. By studying these clues, we can learn about the lives of people who lived a long time ago and imagine what they might have been like. They are like puzzles that help us understand our history.  ​

When Mary went to the museum to learn about prehistory, she wanted to know what life was like before humans formed civilizations. She didn't just want to look at pictures – she wanted to see real artifacts that people had used a long time ago. Mary started by examining fossils of ancient animals that had roamed the earth. She was especially interested in learning about tools that early humans had used to survive. So, she asked the museum curator if she could help excavate some of the artifacts that had been found. As she dug, she found old stones and bones that told a story of how early humans had lived. Mary's hard work paid off, and she was able to help uncover the secrets of prehistoric life.

Prehistory began thousands of years ago. A man named Cro-Magnon took initiative to learn more about the world around him. He asked questions about the animals that roamed the land and the plants that grew. He wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys"" of how life survived in this harsh environment.
