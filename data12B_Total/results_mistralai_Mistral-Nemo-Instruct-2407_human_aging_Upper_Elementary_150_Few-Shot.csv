As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Human aging is a journey like Johnson's or Ruth's, filled with changes and challenges. Imagine Grandma Rose, who was once a young woman, now with silver hair and wrinkles. Her body doesn't move as quickly as it used to, and she needs glasses to read. This is her aging process, a natural part of life. But Grandma Rose doesn't let it stop her. She asks questions, learns new things, and even helps others understand their own aging. She's like a leader, teaching others about the ""hows"" and ""whys"" of getting older. Her story is one of resilience and growth, proving that aging is not just about loss, but also about gaining wisdom and experience.",7.1,72.46,8.3,9.3,8.6,8.23,4.3,7.142857142857142

As humans grow older, they start to see changes in their bodies and minds. They might have less energy, like how Johnson felt after working on math problems. Their skin may wrinkle, similar to how the fields looked after the harvest in Example 2. Older people might also have trouble remembering things, much like how Ruth forgot her hunger and tiredness when she saw Boaz's fields.

As you write, consider what students at this level might already know or understand about human aging, and what they might find interesting or new.

Human aging is a natural process that happens to all living things, including humans. As people get older, their bodies and minds change. They might not be able to move as fast or see as well as they used to. Some parts of the body might not work as well as they used to, like the heart or the brain. But even though people change as they age, they can still do many things and enjoy life. Some older people even become wise leaders, like Johnson in the story, because they have learned so much over their long lives.",6.2,80.11,8.2,9.2,8.62,7.83,4.24,7.142857142857142

As you write, try to keep the following in mind: The aging process is gradual and varies among individuals; it's influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and environment; it's characterized by physical changes and increased risk of certain diseases.

As people age, their bodies change gradually, much like how Ruth and Naomi journeyed together. Some people might notice these changes earlier than others, just as Ruth might have noticed the harvest before Naomi. These changes are influenced by many factors, like how Ruth's love for Naomi affected their journey. Some of these factors are within our control, like the choices we make in our daily lives, while others are not, similar to the famine that led Ruth and Naomi to Bethlehem. These changes often include our skin becoming less smooth and our bones becoming more fragile, much like how the fields change from green and lush to golden and harvested. As we age, we also become more at risk for certain diseases, just as the harvesters became more at risk of dropping some",8.0,70.02,9.8,10.3,9.75,8.81,4.62,7.142857142857142

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 150 words. As humans age, they often ask questions. They wonder why they can't do things as easily as before. They also want to know why they feel tired more quickly. By asking these questions, older adults can understand their changing bodies better. This understanding can help them make choices to stay healthy. For example, they might decide to eat healthier foods or start exercising regularly. In this way, understanding aging can help older adults live more fulfilling lives.",6.7,73.27,8.1,9.6,8.46,8.29,4.15,7.142857142857142

As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.

As people grow older, they start to feel tired more easily. Their bodies don't work as well as they used to. For example, they may need glasses to see things that are far away. Their bones and muscles also change, making it harder for them to run and play like they did when they were younger. But just like Johnson asked questions to learn, older people can learn new things too. And like Ruth, they can find joy in simple things, even when their bodies aren't as strong as before.",6.0,80.72,8.0,9.0,8.36,7.83,4.13,7.142857142857142

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 150 words. As you write, consider the process of human aging like a math problem, with specific ""hows,"" ""whys,"" and ""why nots"" involved.

Human aging is like a math problem we all solve over time. As we grow older, our bodies change, like how our bones become more brittle and our skin wrinkles. Why does this happen? It's because our cells divide and reproduce less quickly, and the ones that stay in our body wear out. Why not? Scientists aren't sure, but they're working on finding out, just like Katherine Johnson wanted to know the ""whys"" of math problems. They hope to find ways to help us age more healthily, just as Johnson helped NASA's rocket land safely.",6.1,80.41,8.4,9.1,8.53,8.0,4.31,7.142857142857142

As human beings grow older, their bodies change. They might not be as strong as they used to be. Their hair might turn gray or fall out. Their skin might wrinkle. These changes are a normal part of aging. Even though these changes can make older adults look different, they are still the same person inside. They have lived many years and have many stories to tell.",5.4,82.04,7.4,8.8,7.85,7.65,4.04,7.142857142857142
