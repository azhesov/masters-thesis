**Final Output:**

Nutrition is the process of providing food to our body. This food gives us energy and helps us grow. It also keeps us healthy. To have good nutrition, we need to eat a mix of foods. These include fruits, vegetables, grains, and proteins like meat or beans. Drinking water is also very important. Too much or too little of certain foods can make us sick. So, we must balance our meals. This is called a balanced diet.",4.6,78.96,6.1,8.3,6.25,7.33,3.62,5.0

**Final Output:**

Nutrition is what we eat. It helps our body grow, work, and stay healthy. We need different kinds of food to get all the nutrients. These include proteins for muscles, carbohydrates for energy, and vitamins and minerals for overall health. Eating a mix of fruits, vegetables, grains, and proteins gives us a balanced diet. This means we get all the nutrients we need. But, too much or too little of certain foods can cause problems. So, it's important to eat a variety of foods in the right amounts. This is called a balanced diet.
