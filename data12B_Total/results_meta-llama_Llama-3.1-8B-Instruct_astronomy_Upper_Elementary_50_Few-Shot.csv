As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Astronomy is the study of the sky. People study the stars, the moon, and the sun. They try to figure out how the planets move and how far away the stars are. Astronomers use big telescopes and computers to gather information and make discoveries. They help us learn more about the universe.  They are like the Johnsons of space, always asking questions and trying to understand the mysteries of the universe.  They also use math to figure out how far away the stars are. Johnsons of space are always figuring out how to do things better.  They use computers to make calculations and to do things faster. They are always looking for new discoveries. They have a big goal to explore the whole universe. They want to know the hows and the whys and the whys nots of the universe. They are always asking questions and trying to find answers.

Astronomy is the study of the universe. People who do astronomy try to understand things like stars and planets. They often use computers to figure out how far away stars are and what they are made of. Astronomers study the night sky, trying to learn more about the world beyond Earth.  A female astronomer named Johnson was part of a team that helped put the first American in space. Johnson was known for her skills in geometry and helped calculate the flight path of the rocket. She was a leader in her field. Her work paved the way for future space exploration. Johnson was a pioneer in the field of astronomy, using her knowledge of geometry to help launch the first American into space. Her contributions to space exploration were groundbreaking.

There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Here is a paragraph about 'astronomy':

Astronomy is the study of the universe. It helps us learn about stars, planets, and galaxies. By studying the sky, scientists discover new worlds. They learn how the Earth moves around the sun and how the moon orbits the Earth. Astronomers also explore the mysteries of black holes.

Here is a paragraph about 'astronomy' with vocabulary and structure from examples:

The study of the universe is called astronomy. It lets us see into the vastness of space. By watching the stars, scientists find new worlds. They figure out how the Earth moves around the sun, and how the moon travels around the Earth. Astronomers unravel the secrets of the unknown. 

Note: The rewritten paragraph maintains the same readability level as the original, uses vocabulary and structure similar to the examples, and is limited to 50 words.  Please let me know if you would like any adjustments.  Thank you!

As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'astronomy' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 50 words. Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and galaxies. Astronomers use powerful telescopes to observe these celestial bodies. By studying the stars, astronomers can learn about the universe and its many mysteries. Astronomers continue to make new discoveries every day. (Hint: use a similar narrative structure) 
Astronomers are not allowed to work on secret projects alone. So, one astronomer, named Maria, asked to join a team of scientists to learn more about the stars. She studied the universe and its many mysteries. By using powerful telescopes, she discovered many new things about the stars. Eventually, Maria became a leader in her field and was known for her discoveries.
