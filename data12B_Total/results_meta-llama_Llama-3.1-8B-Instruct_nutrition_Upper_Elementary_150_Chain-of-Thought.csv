## Step 1: Explain 'nutrition' in simple terms.
Nutrition is the process by which our bodies get the energy and materials they need to grow, repair, and function properly. It involves eating a variety of foods that provide different nutrients, such as proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. These nutrients are like building blocks that help our bodies grow and repair tissues, make energy for our cells, and support our immune system. Just like a car needs gasoline to run, our bodies need the right foods to function correctly. When we eat a balanced diet, we are giving our bodies the fuel they need to stay healthy and strong. A healthy diet also helps us maintain a healthy weight, have plenty of energy, and feel good.

Here is the revised text: 
Good nutrition means eating food that helps your body grow strong and healthy. Eating the right foods can help you feel happy and have lots of energy. Food is like gasoline for your body, and just like a car needs the right kind of gasoline to run well, your body needs the right kinds of foods to work properly. Fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are like the premium gasoline for your body. They give you the energy and nutrients you need to run, play, and learn. On the other hand, foods that are high in sugar and fat are like the low-grade gasoline that can make your body feel sluggish and tired. By eating a balanced diet, you can help keep your body running smoothly and feeling its best.
I made the following changes to the original text:
- I replaced the word ""nutrients"" with ""energy and nutrients"" to make it more accessible to an upper elementary reader.

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 150 words that follows your plan. 
Nutrition is the food that our bodies need to grow and work properly. Just like a car needs gasoline to run, our bodies need food to give us energy. Food is made up of three main parts: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates come from grains, fruits, and vegetables. They give us energy to run, play, and learn. Proteins come from meats, beans, and nuts. They help our bodies grow and repair themselves. Fats come from oils, nuts, and seeds. They help our bodies absorb the vitamins and minerals that we need to stay healthy. We need to eat a variety of foods to get all of the nutrients that our bodies need. This is called a balanced diet. A balanced diet helps us feel our best and stay healthy.

Step 4: Read over your paragraph and make sure it makes sense.
Here's a paragraph about nutrition:
Nutrition is the process of getting the right foods and drinks to help our bodies grow strong and healthy. When we eat, our body breaks down the food into tiny pieces called nutrients. These nutrients help us have energy, build strong bones and muscles, and even help us think clearly. Our bodies need different types of nutrients, like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, to work properly. We can get these nutrients from a variety of foods, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean meats, and dairy products. Eating a balanced diet with a variety of foods helps us stay healthy and feel our best. It's like filling up a car's gas tank with the right kind of fuel so it can run smoothly and efficiently.

The food we eat is like fuel for our bodies. It helps us run, play, and do all the things we love. Nutrition is the study of how the food we eat affects our bodies. It helps us understand how to make the best choices to stay healthy. Food is made up of three main parts: carbohydrates, proteins, and fats. Carbohydrates give us energy to run and play. Proteins help our bodies fix and build things like muscles and skin. Fats help keep our bodies warm and give us energy. When we eat the right balance of these three parts, our bodies work at their best. This is called a healthy diet. A healthy diet helps us stay strong and feel good.
