Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. This summary should provide a general overview of human aging.
Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process that is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. It is characterized by a decline in physical, cognitive, and biological functions, which can lead to increased susceptibility to age-related diseases and disabilities. The aging process is a gradual one, with most people experiencing a steady decline in physical function and an increase in age-related diseases as they get older.

Research suggests that human aging is a result of a combination of factors, including telomere shortening, epigenetic changes, and the accumulation of oxidative stress and cellular damage. Lifestyle factors, such as diet, exercise, and smoking, can also contribute to the aging process. Additionally, genetic factors, such as single nucleotide polymorphisms, can influence an individual's risk of developing age-related diseases.
