Nutrition is the study of how the body uses food for energy, growth, and repair. It involves understanding the different types of food, their nutrients, and how they affect the body. Nutrition helps people make informed choices about what they eat, which can improve their overall health and well-being. A balanced diet that includes a variety of foods can provide the body with the necessary nutrients for optimal function.

Here is the answer to the problem:

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'nutrition' in 100 words.
Nutrition is the process by which organisms obtain and use energy from food. This process involves the consumption of food, its digestion and absorption of nutrients, and the use of these nutrients for growth, repair, and maintenance of the body. Nutrition is essential for the survival and proper functioning of all living organisms, from plants to animals. It includes the intake of macronutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, as well as micronutrients like vitamins and minerals.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, so it will target Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of approximately 8.

Here's a sample output based on your specifications:


Nutrition is the process by which the body uses the food we eat to give us energy. The food we eat is made up of carbohydrates, proteins, and fats, which are broken down into different types of energy. The body needs the right balance of these nutrients to stay healthy. If we don't get enough of any one type, we can feel tired, weak, or even get sick. That's why it's so important to eat a balanced diet that includes lots of fruits and vegetables, whole grains, and lean proteins. By eating a balanced diet, we can stay healthy and have plenty of energy to play and have fun. Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level: 8.8. Metric value: 8.8.

Here is the explanation for the steps:

## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'nutrition' in 100 words.
To explain 'nutrition' in 100 words, we need to break it down into simple terms that an 8th grader can understand. Nutrition refers to the process of getting the right amount of nutrients from the food we eat. Nutrients are substances that help our bodies grow and stay healthy. They include carbohydrates, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. A balanced diet that includes a variety of foods can provide all the nutrients our bodies need to function properly.

Nutrition is the process of how your body gets energy from the food you eat. Your body needs different kinds of nutrients like carbohydrates, proteins, and fats to function properly. When you eat food, your body breaks it down into these nutrients. It then uses them to give you energy to move, think, and grow. Nutrition also helps you stay healthy by fighting off sicknesses and keeping your body strong. A healthy diet with the right balance of nutrients is very important for your overall well-being. It can help you feel good and stay healthy throughout your life.
