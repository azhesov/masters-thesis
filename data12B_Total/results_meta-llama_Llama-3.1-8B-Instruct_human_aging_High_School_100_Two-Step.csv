Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex and multifaceted process that is influenced by a combination of genetic and environmental factors. As we age, our cells and tissues undergo a series of changes that affect their structure and function. These changes can lead to a decline in physical and cognitive abilities, as well as an increased risk of age-related diseases such as cancer and cardiovascular disease. While some aging is inevitable, research has identified various factors that can influence the aging process, including lifestyle choices, nutrition, and stress levels. Understanding the biology of aging can help us develop strategies to promote healthy aging and prevent age-related diseases. Posted in: #Aging #Health
