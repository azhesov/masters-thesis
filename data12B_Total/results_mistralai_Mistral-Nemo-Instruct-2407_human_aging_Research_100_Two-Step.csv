Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive, time-dependent changes at the cellular and molecular levels, leading to functional decline and increased susceptibility to diseases. It's influenced by both intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environmental) factors, with telomere shortening, epigenetic modifications, and the accumulation of cellular damage playing significant roles. Theories of aging include oxidative stress, cellular senescence, and stem cell exhaustion, with no single theory fully explaining the process. Interventions like caloric restriction and exercise, along with advancements in medicine and technology, may slow aging and extend healthspan, but a definitive cure remains elusive.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Research and limit the output to 100 words:
