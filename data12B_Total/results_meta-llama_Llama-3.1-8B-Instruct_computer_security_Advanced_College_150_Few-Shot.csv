Debugging is the process of finding and resolving of defects that prevent correct operation of computer software or a system. Debugging tends to be harder when various subsystems are tightly coupled, as changes in one may cause bugs to emerge in another.
Numerous books have been written about debugging, as it involves numerous aspects, including interactive debugging, control flow, integration testing, log files, monitoring (application, system), memory dumps, profiling, Statistical Process Control, and special design tactics to improve detection while simplifying changes. The terms ""bug"" and ""debugging"" are popularly attributed to Admiral Grace Hopper in the 1940s. While she was working on a Mark II Computer at Harvard University, her associates discovered a moth stuck in a relay and thereby impeding operation, whereupon she remarked that they were ""debugging"" the system. However the term ""bug"" in the meaning of technical error dates back at least to 1878 and Thomas Edison, and ""debugging"" seems to have been used as a term in aeronautics before entering the world of computers.

Here is a robust definition of computer security: the protection of computer systems from theft or damage to their hardware, software, or electronic data. This involves numerous strategies and measures that are constantly evolving due to rapid advancements in technology. Among the numerous types of computer security threats are malware, viruses, and hacking, which can result in the unauthorized access to sensitive data and its exploitation for malicious purposes. Effective security measures require careful planning, implementation, and continuous monitoring. Regular updates of software and hardware, firewalls, encryption, and backups are essential for safeguarding against cyber threats. Furthermore, understanding human psychology and behavior is crucial in developing effective countermeasures against social engineering, a form of psychological manipulation that can lead to the compromise of security systems. Thus, computer security is a multifaceted and ongoing challenge.
