As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

When the first astronauts went to space, scientists wanted to know if there were other planets with life. They looked at the stars and planets through big telescopes. These telescopes helped them see far away things. They saw many planets, but they couldn't tell if they had life. So, they sent robots to explore Mars. These robots took pictures and sent them back to Earth. Astronomy is like detective work. We look for clues in the universe to solve mysteries about life on other planets.",6.7,73.47,7.8,9.2,8.25,8.05,4.06,7.142857142857142

Astronomers study the sky, asking questions about stars, planets, and galaxies. They don't just look up and enjoy the view — they want to understand how things work. So, they use special tools to observe and measure. Sometimes, they even travel to places far from cities to see the sky better. Astronomers work together in teams, sharing their findings. They also teach others about the universe, helping everyone appreciate the beauty and mysteries of the night sky.",6.9,72.97,8.4,9.5,8.45,8.52,4.23,7.142857142857142

In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'astronomy' targeting the same readability level (Upper Elementary), limited to 200 words. In this story, a girl named Amelia is the main character.

When Amelia looked up at the night sky, she saw stars shining down on her. She wanted to know more than just their names, she wanted to understand how they twinkled. She started asking questions, just like Katherine Johnson did with math. Amelia asked her teacher about constellations and planets. She even joined an astronomy club with other kids who loved the stars as much as she did. Amelia began to stand out, and her teacher asked her to help lead a project about the phases of the moon. She was excited to share her new knowledge with her classmates, just like Ruth shared grain with Naomi.",5.9,80.92,8.1,9.2,8.41,8.12,4.13,7.142857142857142
