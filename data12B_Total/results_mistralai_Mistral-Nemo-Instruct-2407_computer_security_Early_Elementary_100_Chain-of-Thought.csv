   Computers are like big, smart toys. They help us play games, watch movies, and even do our homework. But, like any toy, we need to keep them safe. This is what computer security is about. It's like having a secret password to protect your toys from others. It helps keep our computers and the things we do on them safe and private.",5.4,76.82,6.2,9.2,8.06,7.35,3.79,5.666666666666667

Because computers hold our important information, we need to keep them safe. This is called computer security. Imagine a big, strong box to keep your toys safe. You would not want anyone to take them, right? Similarly, computer security helps protect our information from being stolen or harmed. We use special keys, or passwords, to lock our computers. Sometimes, we also use shields, or firewalls, to protect our computers from bad guys on the internet. These are like the guard dogs that protect our houses. So, remember, computer security is like a strong box with a password lock and a firewall guard dog.",6.3,69.07,7.7,10.2,7.51,9.61,3.63,5.0

Sure, buddy! Imagine you're playing with your favorite toys at home. You want to keep them safe, right? You wouldn't want anyone to take them or break them. That's what computer security is like! It's like having a secret lock on your toys to keep them safe from bad guys. When we talk about computer security, we're talking about protecting computers and the important stuff inside them, like your games and pictures, from people who might want to harm them. Just like you'd lock your toys away in a safe place, we use special rules and tools to keep computers safe too. Isn't that cool?",5.8,75.61,7.1,9.3,7.42,8.05,3.64,4.8

A computer is like a secret treasure chest. Computer security is like making sure no one else can open it. Just like we keep our toys safe with locks and passwords, computers need special keys called passwords and codes to stay secure. We must never share these keys with others, just like we wouldn't give our toy box key to a stranger. Also, we should always update the locks when told to, similar to how we replace old toy box locks with new ones. This keeps the treasure safe from thieves.",6.2,74.59,7.3,9.1,8.38,8.23,3.96,6.5
