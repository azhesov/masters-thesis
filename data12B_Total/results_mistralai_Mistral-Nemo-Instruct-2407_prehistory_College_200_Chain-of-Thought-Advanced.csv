Prehistory refers to the time before written records were kept. This period stretches from the emergence of Homo sapiens, our earliest human ancestors, until the invention of writing. It spans over 95% of human history, encompassing significant events like the development of tools, the spread of early humans across the globe, and the rise and fall of civilizations. Archaeologists and anthropologists study this era by examining physical remains such as fossils, artifacts, and architectural structures. These remnants provide valuable insights into our ancestors' lives, cultures, and environments. Prehistory is often divided into different periods based on the types of tools and technology used, with the most recent being the Mesolithic, Neolithic, and Bronze Ages. Understanding prehistory helps us appreciate the full story of human evolution and the path that led to our modern world.",9.9,48.81,11.8,12.0,11.31,13.04,5.07,5.0

**Paragraph:**

""Prehistory is the time before written history. It starts with the first humans and ends when people began recording events. This period spans over 99% of human existence. People lived as hunter-gatherers, relying on nature for survival. They didn't have written languages or permanent homes. Instead, they communicated through art, tools, and customs. Archaeologists study this era using artifacts and fossils. Prehistory is crucial for understanding human evolution and early cultures.""

Output:
""Prehistory is the time before written records were kept. It started with the first humans and ended when people began writing things down. This period covers a vast span of time, from about 3.3 million years ago to around 3300 BCE. During prehistory, humans evolved, migrated across continents, and developed tools and culture. However, we learn about this era mainly through archaeology, as direct records don't exist. This makes studying prehistory a fascinating challenge.""

**Step 1:**
Prehistory refers to the time period before written records were kept. This means we don't have books or documents from that time to learn about it directly. Instead, we rely on physical evidence like artifacts, fossils, and structures left behind by ancient humans and their ancestors. This evidence helps us understand how these early societies lived, what they ate, and how they interacted with each other and their environment.

**Step 2:**
To target a Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of 13, I'll use complex sentences, varied sentence structure, and advanced vocabulary. I'll aim for an average of 18 words per sentence and include a mix of simple, compound, and complex sentences.

**Step 3:**
Before writing, I'll estimate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of the draft to ensure it meets the target.

**Output:**

Prehistory, a vast span of time before written records, stretches from the dawn of humans around 3 million years ago until the invention of writing, roughly 5,000 years ago. This era is divided into three main periods: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Each period is characterized by the primary materials humans used for tools and weapons. During the Stone Age, humans used stone, wood, and bone. The Bronze Age saw the development of metallurgy, with bronze being the primary metal used. Finally, the Iron Age marked the transition to iron as the primary metal. Archaeologists study artifacts from these periods to understand how early humans lived, worked, and interacted with their environment.

Prehistory, the era before written history, spans from the earliest humans to the invention of writing. It covers the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. These periods are defined by the tools humans used. In the Stone Age, people used stone tools for hunting, gathering, and making shelter. The Bronze Age began when people learned to smelt copper and tin to make bronze, a stronger material for tools and weapons. The Iron Age followed as people discovered how to smelt iron. Prehistory ends when people started recording their history in writing, around 3200 BCE in Mesopotamia. This marks the beginning of civilization as we understand it today.",6.6,68.36,8.7,9.7,7.62,10.19,3.96,5.2

Prehistory refers to the time before written records were kept. This period began with the earliest humans and ended with the invention of writing. It spanned millions of years, from around 6 million BC to about 3000 BC. During this time, humans migrated from Africa to other parts of the world.
