Prehistory is a long period of time that started around 2.6 million years ago. This was before people started writing things down. So, we don't have books or newspapers from this time. Instead, we learn about prehistory from things like fossils, cave paintings, and tools made by early humans. These help us understand how people lived, what they ate, and how they worked together. Prehistory ends around 3300 BC, when people started using symbols to write things down. This is when history begins.",6.0,69.89,8.0,9.4,6.79,10.24,3.8,5.15

Prehistory is a term used to describe the time before written history. It starts with the earliest human-like species and ends around 3000 BCE, when writing was first invented. This period covers a vast span of time, from about 6 million years ago until the advent of civilizations. Prehistory is often divided into several stages based on the development of human skills and technologies. One of the most well-known periods is the Stone Age, which is further divided into the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age) eras. During these times, humans learned to make tools from stone and other materials, develop hunting and gathering skills, and eventually, cultivate crops and domesticate animals. Archaeologists, who study past human cultures, often use artifacts like tools, bones, and structures to understand and interpret prehistory. These artifacts provide valuable insights into how our early ancestors lived, adapted, and evolved.",11.0,45.96,13.3,13.7,12.91,13.57,5.31,8.857142857142858

In simpler terms, prehistory is the period of time before written history began. This means it's the time before people started recording events and information in books or other written forms. It's a very long time ago, before many of the things we use and know today were invented. During this time, people lived in different ways, using tools made from stones, bones, or wood. They were hunters, gatherers, and sometimes farmers. They didn't have electricity or modern technology, but they had their own ways of understanding the world and communicating with each other. Archaeologists study this time period by looking for and examining the things people made and used, like tools, art, and buildings. This helps us learn about how people lived and what their lives were like before written history began.",9.1,56.35,10.6,11.0,9.72,11.3,4.44,6.875

In prehistory, humans didn't write books or keep records. This time, called the Stone Age, lasted from 3.3 million years ago until 3300 BCE. People lived in small groups, called tribes. They hunted animals and gathered plants for food. They didn't have cities or farms. To communicate, they used signs and sounds. They made tools from stones and bones. These tools were simple, but important for survival. Prehistory ended when people began writing and building cities.",5.1,72.12,7.7,8.1,6.12,10.05,3.51,3.583333333333333

In the context of human history, prehistory refers to the time period before written records were created. This era began with the emergence of the first humans, Homo habilis, around 2.6 million years ago. It ended approximately 5,000 years ago when writing was first invented. During this time, humans were hunters and gatherers, living off the land and adapting to their environments. They created tools and weapons from natural materials, and developed simple shelters. Over time, they migrated across the globe, populating every continent except Antarctica. Prehistory is often divided into different periods based on the types of tools and technologies humans used. Understanding this era helps us learn about the earliest human behaviors and adaptations.",9.2,50.84,11.1,12.4,12.38,13.56,5.01,6.666666666666667

Prehistory refers to the time before written history. It starts when humans first appeared around 2.6 million years ago and ends when people began recording events, about 3300 BCE in Mesopotamia. This period is divided into several eras based on tool-making techniques. The Stone Age is the longest, further divided into Lower, Middle, and Upper. Lower Paleolithic (2.6 million - 300,000 years ago) saw the first stone tools. Middle (300,000 - 50,000 years ago) brought more sophisticated tools. Upper (50,000 - 3300 BCE) introduced new materials like bone and ivory. The Bronze Age (3300 - 1200 BCE) saw the use of metal for tools.

""Prehistory"" refers to the time before humans started writing, roughly before 3000 BCE.
