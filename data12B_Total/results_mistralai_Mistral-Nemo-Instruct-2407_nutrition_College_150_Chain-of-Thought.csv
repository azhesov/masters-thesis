""Nutrition, at its core, is the science of how food and drink affect our bodies. It encompasses the study of nutrients - vitamins, minerals, proteins, fats, and carbohydrates - and their roles in sustaining life. To understand nutrition is to grasp how these components interact with our body systems, influencing everything from physical growth and energy levels to overall health and disease risk. Nutritionists, therefore, are not merely concerned with what we consume, but also with how our bodies process and use these nutrients. They explore dietary guidelines, nutritional deficiencies, and the impact of different foods on health, ultimately aiming to promote optimal wellness through balanced and informed eating.""",10.9,46.17,13.3,13.2,12.81,13.74,5.89,10.142857142857142

Nutrition, in its broadest sense, refers to the process by which organisms consume and assimilate food to sustain life and growth. It encompasses the intake, digestion, absorption, and metabolism of nutrients, which are the components of food that provide energy and promote the development and maintenance of body structures and functions. For instance, carbohydrates, proteins, and fats are essential nutrients that serve as primary energy sources, while vitamins and minerals play crucial roles in various physiological processes. Understanding and maintaining adequate nutrition is vital for both individual health and overall societal well-being, as it underpins physical growth, cognitive development, and overall quality of life. Moreover, appropriate nutrition is key to preventing and managing chronic diseases, such as diabetes",12.6,36.59,14.8,15.4,15.7,14.96,6.25,8.428571428571429
