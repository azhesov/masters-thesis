Prehistory, a term coined by French archaeologist Gabriel de Mortillet in 1864, refers to the period of human existence before written records. This era spans from the first appearance of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing systems, which occurred independently in various civilizations between 3400 BCE and 660 BCE. Prehistory is typically divided into three main periods: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, each characterized by the primary material used for tool and weapon production. These periods are further divided into sub-periods based on cultural and technological advancements, such as the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras within the Stone Age. Archaeological findings, including artifacts, fossils, and architectural remnants, serve as primary sources for understanding prehistoric societies, their cultures, and their evolution.",11.8,38.52,13.6,13.6,13.34,14.38,5.54,6.0

Here's the plan and the final paragraph:

Plan:
- Start with a broad definition of prehistory.
- Explain that it spans a vast time period.
- Mention key events and developments that occurred during prehistory.
- End with a brief sentence about the significance of studying this era.

Final Paragraph:
""Prehistory refers to the time before written records, which stretches back to the dawn of human existence. This vast era, spanning nearly 3 million years, witnessed significant developments. Early humans first appeared in Africa, then migrated globally. They mastered fire, created tools, and developed complex cultures. Prehistory ended around 3300 BCE when writing was invented. Studying this era helps us understand our origins and evolution.""

Prehistory, the time before written records, is a vast period of human history. It begins around 3.3 million years ago, when the first humans, Homo habilis, appeared in Africa. This era ends around 3,300 years ago, when written language emerged in ancient civilizations like Mesopotamia and Egypt. During this time, humans evolved from tool-using hominids to complex societies, migrating across the globe, and developing art, culture, and technology. Prehistory is divided into several periods based on climate, technology, and human evolution, including the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Archaeologists, who study past human cultures, use artifacts, fossils, and environmental evidence to understand this critical period in human history.

The term 'prehistory' refers to the period before written history began. It spans from the dawn of humanity around 3 million years ago until the invention of writing, which occurred at different times across various civilizations. Prehistory is often divided into Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age periods, each marked by advancements in tool-making and technology. Archaeologists study prehistory by analyzing artifacts, structures, and other physical remains left behind by our ancestors.
