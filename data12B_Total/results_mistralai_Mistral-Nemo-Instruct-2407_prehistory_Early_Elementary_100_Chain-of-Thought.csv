Paragraph:
""Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down. That's a long time ago! It's like when cavemen lived. They didn't have computers or cars. They used tools made from rocks and bones. Archaeologists study this time by finding old stuff, like bones, tools, and art made on cave walls. This helps us understand how people lived way back then.""",5.3,77.13,7.9,8.4,6.94,9.2,3.54,6.25

Prehistory is a long time ago, before people wrote things down. It's like when you were a baby, and you couldn't talk or write yet. Archaeologists are like detectives who look for clues from that time. They find old tools made by humans, like stones used to cut things. These tools are evidence that people lived there long ago.

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. Check for understanding and make changes as needed.

**Step 1:** To explain 'prehistory' to an Early Elementary reader, I'll use simple language and compare it to a storybook. I'll describe it as the time before people started writing, and talk about how we learn about this period through things people made and left behind.

**Step 2:** Appropriate vocabulary might include: time, people, write, book, story, make, leave, learn, thing, period. I'll use short, simple sentences and avoid complex words or concepts.

**Step 3:** ""Long ago, there was a time called prehistory. This was before people could write stories in books. People lived, but we don't have their stories written down. We learn about this time by finding things people made and left behind, like tools, paintings, and homes. These help us understand what life was like before books.""
