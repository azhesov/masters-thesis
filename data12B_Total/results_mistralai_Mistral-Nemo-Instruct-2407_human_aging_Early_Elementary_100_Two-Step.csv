Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by a progressive decline in physiological function and increased susceptibility to diseases. It is influenced by both intrinsic factors, such as genetic predisposition, and extrinsic factors, like lifestyle and environment. Cellular changes, including telomere shortening and epigenetic alterations, contribute to aging. Longevity is determined by the interaction of these factors, with maximum lifespan set by genetic limits and actual lifespan influenced by health and lifestyle choices.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Early Elementary and limit the output to 100 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by progressive, time-dependent changes at molecular, cellular, and systemic levels. It is associated with an increased risk of age-related diseases and a decline in physiological functions, ultimately leading to increased vulnerability and mortality. Key hallmarks include genomic instability, telomere attrition, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, cellular senescence, stem cell exhaustion, and altered intercellular communication. The pace of aging varies among individuals and is influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and environment.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Early Elementary and limit the output to 100 words:
