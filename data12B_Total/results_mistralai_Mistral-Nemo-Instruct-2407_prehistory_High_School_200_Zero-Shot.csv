In the context of human history, prehistory refers to the time period before written records began. This era spans from the earliest tool use by hominids, around 3.3 million years ago, to the invention of writing systems, approximately 5,000 years ago. Prehistory is often divided into several periods based on cultural developments and technological advancements. These include the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. During the Stone Age, early humans used tools made from stone and bone. They were primarily hunter-gatherers, relying on nature for food and shelter. The Bronze Age saw significant advancements in metallurgy, allowing for the creation of stronger tools and weapons. The Iron Age further revolutionized technology with the use of iron, leading to improved tools and structures. Although there are no written records from prehistory, archaeologists and anthropologists study artifacts, fossils, and other physical evidence to understand the lives of our ancestors during this time.

Prehistory, the period before written records, is a fascinating era that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. It's divided into three main stages: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. During the Stone Age, humans used stone tools for hunting, gathering, and making shelters. They migrated across the globe, leaving behind evidence of their cultures and technologies. The Bronze Age began when humans discovered how to smelt copper and tin to create a harder, more durable metal. This innovation allowed for advancements in tools, weapons, and architecture. Finally, the Iron Age started when humans learned to smelt iron, which was even stronger than bronze. This led to further technological progress and the growth of civilizations. Despite the lack of written records, archaeologists and anthropologists use artifacts, structures, and other physical remains to study prehistory, shedding light on our ancient ancestors' lives and accomplishments.",9.3,55.74,12.5,12.1,12.08,13.63,5.14,8.142857142857142

Prehistory refers to the vast period of time before written history began. It spans from the origin of the universe, through the evolution of life on Earth, and up to the invention of writing systems. This era is divided into several epochs, each marked by significant geological or biological events. For instance, the Precambrian eon, lasting nearly four billion years, witnessed the formation of the Earth and the emergence of early life forms. The Paleozoic era, around 541 million to 252 million years ago, saw the rise of complex marine life and the first forests. The Mesozoic era, from 252 million to 66 million years ago, is known for the age of dinosaurs. The Cenozoic era, starting 66 million years ago, brought about the extinction of non-avian dinosaurs and the rise of mammals.

The first stage, known as the Stone Age, spanned from the first use of stone tools by hominids around 2.6 million years ago to the end of the last ice age about 12,000 years ago. During this time, humans evolved from early hominids like Australopithecus to modern humans, Homo sapiens. The Stone Age is further divided into the Lower Paleolithic, Middle Paleolithic, and Upper Paleolithic periods, each marked by distinct tool-making techniques. The Copper Age, or Chalcolithic period, followed, characterized by the use of copper tools alongside stone tools. This era saw advancements in agriculture and the development of permanent settlements. Finally, the Bronze Age began around 3300 BCE with the widespread use of bronze, an alloy of copper and tin.

The paragraph should explain what prehistory is, when it occurred, and its significance in human history.

Prehistory, a term derived from Greek words 'pre' meaning before and 'historia' meaning history, refers to the time period before written records were created by humans. This era spans from the first appearance of Homo sapiens, around 300,000 years ago, until the invention of writing, approximately 5,000 years ago. Prehistory is significant in human history as it marks the period when our ancestors developed fundamental skills and technologies such as toolmaking, fire control, and complex social structures. These advancements laid the foundation for modern human civilization. Archaeologists study prehistory by examining physical remains like tools, artifacts, and structures, shedding light on the lives of our early ancestors and the origins of human culture.",12.8,35.98,15.0,14.7,14.17,15.26,6.0,12.0
