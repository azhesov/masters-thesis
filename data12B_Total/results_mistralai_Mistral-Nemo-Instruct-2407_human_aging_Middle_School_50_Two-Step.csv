Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 50 words. 'Human aging' is a progressive, irreversible process marked by deterioration of physiological functions, increased susceptibility to diseases, and a heightened risk of death. It starts in our mid-20s, slowing down our metabolism, weakening our muscles, and affecting our memory. As we age, our skin wrinkles, our hair turns gray, and our bodies become more prone to illness.",10.2,53.61,12.1,12.0,12.04,11.6,5.67,11.2

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 50 words. Human aging is a complex process involving multiple biological changes at the cellular and molecular levels. It is characterized by a gradual decline in physical and cognitive functions, increased susceptibility to diseases, and a higher risk of death. The underlying mechanisms are not fully understood, but they are believed to involve DNA damage, telomere shortening, and altered cellular signaling pathways.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Middle School and limit the output to 50 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 50 words. Explain how we grow old.

Human aging is a natural process that happens to everyone. As we get older, our cells divide and grow more slowly. Our bodies also become less efficient at repairing damaged cells. This means that we can get sick more easily. Our skin wrinkles and our bones become weaker. Our senses, like sight and hearing, also get worse. Our brains may not work as well as before. This is why older people often need more help with daily tasks.",5.0,77.84,5.2,8.0,6.27,6.76,3.73,4.8
