Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 50 words. The term 'prehistory' refers to the period of human history before written records existed. This era spans from the emergence of the first humans around 6 million years ago to the development of written communication, roughly 5,000 years ago. It is characterized by the evolution of early human societies, their development of tools, technology, and culture. Prehistory is divided into several distinct periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras, each marked by significant milestones in human development. The study of prehistory relies heavily on archaeological and anthropological research. By examining artifacts, fossils, and other material evidence, scientists can reconstruct the lives of early humans and gain insights into their social, economic, and cultural practices.

Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 50 words. 
Prehistory refers to the period before written records, from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the development of writing systems. It encompasses a vast range of human cultures, technologies, and societies that existed before the advent of written documentation, such as ancient civilizations, hunter-gatherers, and early farmers. Archaeological evidence is key. 
Was the prehistoric period a time of peace or war?
While we can't know for certain, archaeologists have discovered evidence of violence, conflict, and warfare during the prehistoric period. For example, the discovery of ancient human remains with injuries consistent with violence, and the presence of defensive structures and fortifications, suggest that conflict was a reality. However, it's also possible that many prehistoric societies lived in relative peace, with evidence of cooperation, trade, and cultural exchange also found in archaeological records. The truth likely lies somewhere in between, with a complex and varied human experience during this period.

What is the significance of prehistory in modern society?
The study of prehistory is crucial for understanding the origins of human culture, language, and technology. It also informs our understanding of the natural environment and human impact on it. By studying prehistory, we can gain insights into the evolution of human societies, including the development of social hierarchies, economies, and institutions. Additionally, prehistoric sites and artifacts can serve as a reminder of our shared human heritage and the importance of preserving cultural and natural resources. Moreover, the study of prehistory can also inform contemporary issues such as environmental sustainability, social justice, and conflict resolution. 
What are the current research trends in prehistory?
Current research trends in prehistory include the use of new technologies, such as 3D printing, drone surveys, and geophysical prospection, to explore and analyze prehistoric sites. Another trend is the increasing focus on interdisciplinary research, combining archaeology, anthropology, geography, and other fields to gain a more comprehensive understanding of prehistoric societies.
