The United States Department of Agriculture (USDA) defines a healthy diet as one that includes a variety of foods from all food groups. These foods include fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and low-fat dairy products. A well-balanced diet is one that includes a combination of these food groups in the right amounts. The key to a healthy diet is to eat a variety of foods, rather than relying on a single type of food. The USDA recommends that children aged 2-18 consume 1.5-2 cups of fruits and 2-3 cups of vegetables per day. They also recommend that children consume 5-6 ounces of grains, 2-3 ounces of lean protein, and 2-3 cups of low-fat dairy products per day.
