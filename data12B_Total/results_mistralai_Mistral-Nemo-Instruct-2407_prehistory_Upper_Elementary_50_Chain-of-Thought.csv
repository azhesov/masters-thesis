During this time, people lived as hunters and gatherers, using tools made from stones and bones. They didn't have houses, so they lived in caves or built shelters from plants. This time period is sometimes called the 'Stone Age'.",6.4,74.29,8.8,9.2,8.44,9.74,4.04,7.2857142857142865

Before people could write, they didn't leave many records. So, this time period is called prehistory. It started around 2.5 million years ago. During prehistory, people were hunter-gatherers. They lived in small groups and moved around a lot. They didn't farm or live in cities. Instead, they got food by hunting animals and gathering plants. They made tools and art from natural materials. Even though we don't have many written records, archaeologists study the things people left behind to learn about their lives.",5.8,70.29,8.0,9.3,8.03,10.0,3.43,4.166666666666667
