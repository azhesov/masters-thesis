Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. 'Human aging' refers to the progressive changes that occur in an individual over time, ultimately leading to an increased risk of diseases and death. This process is influenced by both intrinsic (genetic) and extrinsic (environmental) factors. Intrinsic factors include the accumulation of cellular damage over time due to processes like oxidation, telomere shortening, and epigenetic modifications. Extrinsic factors encompass lifestyle choices such as poor diet, lack of exercise, smoking, and exposure to harmful chemicals or radiation. Chronic inflammation, immune system decline, and alterations in hormone levels also play significant roles in the aging process. Research is ongoing to understand the complex biology of aging and to develop interventions that could slow, stop, or even reverse its effects.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 200 words:

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 200 words. Human aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by progressive functional decline in various physiological systems, ultimately leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and death. It is influenced by a combination of genetic, stochastic, and environmental factors. Aging is typically divided into primary aging, which is an intrinsic, inevitable process, and secondary aging, which is caused by environmental and lifestyle factors. Primary aging is associated with molecular and cellular changes, such as telomere shortening, DNA damage, and the accumulation of misfolded proteins. These changes contribute to a decline in cellular function and tissue maintenance, leading to organ dysfunction and systemic decline. Secondary aging can be mitigated through healthy lifestyle choices and preventive healthcare, but primary aging is a universal and inevitable part of life. The study of aging is a rapidly evolving field, with ongoing research aimed at understanding the complex mechanisms underlying this process and identifying potential interventions to extend healthy lifespan.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of High School and limit the output to 200 words:

However, aging is a natural part of life, and it's crucial to approach it with respect and understanding.

Human aging is a complex process involving many factors. It's when our bodies slowly stop working as well as they used to. This happens because of things inside us (like our genes) and things outside us (like our environment). Key parts of aging include our cells getting old (telomere shortening), changes in how our genes work (epigenetics), and our body fighting itself (inflammation). Aging makes us more likely to get sick, with common problems like heart disease and memory loss. Scientists study aging to find ways to live healthier for longer. Some ideas include eating less, exercising more, and using special medicines. But remember, aging is a normal part of life, and we should respect it.",11.8,38.52,13.8,13.2,13.3,14.67,5.65,11.285714285714286
