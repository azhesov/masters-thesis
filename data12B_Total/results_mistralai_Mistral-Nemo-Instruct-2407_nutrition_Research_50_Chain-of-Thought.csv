Nutrition, at the research level, refers to the scientific study of food and its effects on the body. It encompasses the identification of nutrients, their roles in health and disease, and the development of dietary recommendations. This interdisciplinary field draws from biochemistry, physiology, and public health, among other disciplines, to advance our understanding of human nutrition and apply it to improve global health outcomes.

Nutrition, at the Research level, is the study of how organisms consume and utilize food to maintain life processes. It encompasses the intake, absorption, metabolism, and excretion of nutrients. Key aspects include macronutrients (carbohydrates, proteins, fats), micronutrients (vitamins, minerals), and their roles in physiological functions. Research delves into the effects of nutrition on health and disease, exploring concepts like nutrition-related genes, biomarkers, and dietary interventions.",11.0,40.55,13.6,12.6,13.16,15.13,5.91,7.625
