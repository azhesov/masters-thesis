Prehistory is a special time in our world's story. It's like when you're playing with your toys, but no one is writing down what's happening. In prehistory, people lived on Earth, but they didn't write things down. They didn't have books to tell us about their lives. So, we call this time 'prehistory', which means 'before writing'. It's like the beginning of our world's story, before anyone could tell",7.0,67.25,9.5,9.8,7.29,9.96,3.58,6.75

Prehistory is a time when there were no written records. It's like when you're playing with your toys, and you don't write down what you did. This was before people invented paper and pens. In prehistory, people didn't have books to learn from. They learned by watching others and sharing stories. This was thousands of years ago, even before kings and queens ruled. People lived in different ways, some were hunters, some were farmers. They used tools made of stone and wood. Prehistory ended when people started writing things down, like when they recorded history.",5.2,77.23,7.8,8.6,6.48,9.55,3.62,5.666666666666667

Prehistory is like a very long time ago when people didn't write books yet. It's the time when our ancestors, like the dinosaurs, lived on Earth. These creatures were huge and some had scales, while others had feathers. They didn't have human parents, so they didn't learn to talk or use tools. Instead, they hunted for food and protected themselves from danger. This was before we had cars, houses, or even schools. We know about this time from fossils, which are like ancient bones and footprints that have turned into rock. Scientists study these fossils to learn more about how the world was long ago. So, prehistory is like a fascinating mystery that we're still trying to solve.",5.8,75.71,7.9,8.6,7.22,9.09,4.03,5.444444444444445

Prehistory is the time before people started writing things down. This was thousands of years ago, before there were books, newspapers, or even caves with pictures painted on the walls. In prehistory, people didn't have many of the things we have today. They didn't have cars, TVs, or computers. Instead, they used tools made from stones and bones. They lived in small groups called tribes and moved around a lot to find food. Prehistory ended when people started to write things down, around 3000 BCE in some places.
