**My Solution:**

Astronomy is like exploring the big, dark sky at night. It's a special way to learn about the sun, the moon, and all the twinkling stars. An astronomer is someone who studies these amazing things in the sky. They use special tools called telescopes to see very far away. Some astronomers even look at planets in other places, far beyond our own Earth. They help us understand how the universe works and what's out there in the big, wide world. It's like going on a wonderful adventure, right in our own backyard, just by looking up at the night sky.",6.1,74.9,7.5,8.8,7.51,8.05,4.07,5.444444444444445

Astronomy is like a big treasure hunt, but instead of finding hidden treasures on Earth, we're looking for stars, planets, and galaxies far away in space. Imagine looking up at the night sky and seeing more than just a few twinkling stars. That's what astronomers do! They use special telescopes to see things that are very, very far away, sometimes even billions of miles! They study these amazing objects and learn about how they move, what they're made of, and how they affect each other. Isn't that incredible? That's the wonderful world of astronomy!",5.9,75.5,8.4,8.6,7.08,9.5,4.11,6.125

Astronomy is like looking at the night sky and asking questions. It's about stars, planets, and even black holes. Imagine you're lying on your back, gazing up at the twinkling stars. An astronomer might wonder, ""How old is that star? Is there a planet around it?"" They use big telescopes to see things we can't. Astronomy helps us learn about space and our place in the universe. It's like going on an adventure, but instead of traveling, we explore with our eyes and brains!",4.9,77.94,6.8,8.4,6.9,8.33,3.9,4.9
