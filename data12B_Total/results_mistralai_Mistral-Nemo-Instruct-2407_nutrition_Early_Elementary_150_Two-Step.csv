Elementary rewrite:
Food gives us energy to play and grow. It has things called nutrients that our bodies need. There are five main nutrients: carbs, proteins, fats, vitamins, and minerals. Carbs give us energy, proteins make us strong, fats keep us warm, and vitamins and minerals help us stay healthy. We need all these in the right amounts for our bodies to work well. How much we need depends on if we're a boy or girl, how old we are, and if we play sports or not. Learning about nutrition helps us pick healthier foods and feel good every day.",8.6,57.57,10.4,12.4,9.71,11.65,4.58,7.75
