Astronomy is the way to look at the sky and stars. It is fun to learn about the world we live in. We can see the sun, moon, and stars in the sky. The sun is a big ball of fire. It makes us warm and bright. The moon is a rock that goes around the earth. It looks like a big rock in the sky. The stars are far away and are like tiny lights. We can see them at night. The earth is a big ball that we live on. It goes around the sun. The earth is special because it has air to breathe and water to drink. We need to take care of the earth so it can stay healthy. We can learn about the earth and the sky by reading books and watching videos. There are many things to learn about in astronomy. It is a big subject that has many fun things to learn.

Planets and moons are like big rocks that go around the stars. The astronomers can also see how fast the stars are moving. They can see how far away they are. Astronomy is fun.
