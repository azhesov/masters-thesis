Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?""

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?"" But the owl says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose. Maybe it is her egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, ""Is this your egg?"" But the goose says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the two ducks. Maybe it is their egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the two ducks. They ask the two ducks, ""Is this your egg?"" But the two ducks say, ""No, that is not our egg."" Then the egg breaks.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?
