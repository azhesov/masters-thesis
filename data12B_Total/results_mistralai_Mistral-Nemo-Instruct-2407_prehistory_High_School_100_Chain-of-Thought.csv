Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. The paragraph should introduce the term 'prehistory' and briefly explain the period it covers. It should also introduce the idea that human history can be divided into smaller time periods.

Prehistory is the time before written records. It covers the entire period of human existence on Earth, from the first appearance of our species, Homo sapiens, around 300,000 years ago, to the invention of writing, about 5,000 years ago. This vast span of time is often divided into smaller periods, such as the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, to help us understand the significant changes that occurred in human life and culture during these times.",9.1,61.77,11.2,11.9,10.52,10.55,4.74,8.285714285714286

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. Include the following elements in your paragraph:
  - Mention that it's before written history.
  - Explain the importance of studying this period.
  - Discuss the types of evidence used by archaeologists.

  - Use at least one transition word to connect your ideas.

Prehistory, the time before written history, is a fascinating era that spans from the emergence of the first humans until the invention of writing. Understanding this period is crucial as it helps us trace our roots and understand how civilizations evolved. Archaeologists, who study human history through material remains, use various types of evidence like artifacts, architecture, and even DNA to reconstruct this distant past. This timeline, which begins around 3.3 million years ago with the earliest hominids and ends approximately 3000 BCE, provides invaluable insights into human cultures, technologies, and societal structures.",9.7,49.31,11.9,12.2,10.89,13.74,4.9,6.222222222222222

""Prehistory refers to the time before written records, when humans didn't leave behind books or newspapers. Instead, we learn about these ancient times through artifacts like tools, art, and buildings. This period spans from when our earliest human ancestors, like Homo habilis, appeared around 2.1 million years ago, up until the invention of writing, which occurred independently in different places and times, such as around 3400 BCE in Mesopotamia.""",8.2,64.1,11.9,10.9,10.28,12.53,4.77,8.0

Prehistory, the time before written records, is a fascinating era when humans first emerged and evolved. It stretches from the earliest stone tools, around 3.3 million years ago, to the invention of writing, roughly 5,000 years ago. This vast period is divided into several key stages: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Archaeologists, scientists who study human history through artifacts and sites, help us understand this time without written words. They use tools like carbon dating to determine the age of objects and reconstruct our ancestors' lives. Prehistory is a window into the past, revealing our journey from simple tool users to complex societies.",9.0,56.66,10.6,11.6,10.5,11.42,4.61,7.0

Prehistory, the time before written history, is a fascinating period that spans from the earliest humans to the invention of writing. This era, often divided into Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages, saw significant developments in human culture and technology. People learned to create tools from stone, metal, and other materials, which helped them hunt, gather, and build shelters. They also developed new ways to grow and prepare food, allowing them to form larger, more stable communities. Over time, these advancements led to the establishment of civilizations, marking the beginning of recorded history.",10.4,47.59,11.9,12.7,12.21,12.64,5.12,8.571428571428571
