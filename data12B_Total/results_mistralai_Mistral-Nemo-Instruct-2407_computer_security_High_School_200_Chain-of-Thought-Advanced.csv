Computer security, or cybersecurity, is protecting computers, networks, and sensitive information from digital threats. These threats can be viruses, hackers, or even employees with malicious intent. Strong security involves several steps. First, use complex passwords and keep them secret. Second, install and update security software regularly. Third, be cautious online, especially when using public Wi-Fi. Fourth, educate yourself and your employees about common scams and how to spot them. Lastly, regularly back up important data. By following these steps, you can significantly reduce the risk of a security breach.",8.3,53.17,10.3,10.8,8.97,12.5,4.71,5.7

**Computer Security Explained**

Computer security, also known as cybersecurity, protects computers, networks, and sensitive data from digital threats. Imagine it's like a fortress, with walls and guards to keep intruders out. In this fortress, the walls represent security measures like firewalls, which control who can access a network, and encryption, which turns readable data into a secret code. The guards are software like antivirus programs that detect and remove harmful viruses or malware. Computer security also involves creating strong passwords and keeping software up-to-date, like having a well-trained, alert army. It's a constant battle because new threats, like cunning enemies, emerge every day. So, everyone who uses computers needs to understand and practice good security habits.",9.3,50.33,11.8,11.2,8.83,13.09,5.03,5.7

**Final Paragraph:**

Computer security, also known as information security, safeguards our digital world from threats and unauthorized access. It involves protecting data, software, and hardware from cyber-attacks like viruses, malware, or hackers. This is achieved through practices like encryption, firewalls, and regular software updates. It's like having a fortress around your computer, with security guards (software) and strong walls (firewalls) to keep intruders out. Without computer security, sensitive information like passwords or personal details could be stolen, causing identity theft or financial loss. Therefore, it's crucial for everyone to understand and practice good computer security habits, keeping our digital lives safe and secure.",9.5,49.92,12.9,12.2,9.83,14.25,5.18,6.333333333333333
