Computer security, or info security, is about protecting computers and networks from digital threats. It involves stopping, finding, and responding to cyber attacks. Key things it does are:
- Keeping data safe from wrong people.
- Making sure data stays correct and complete.
- Making sure people can use data when they need it.
- Checking who's using the system.
- Deciding who can access what.
- Making sure people can't deny they did something.

To do this, you use strong passwords, update software, and use tools like firewalls and encryption. Regular checks, tests, and employee training are also important. As technology changes, so do threats, so you must keep learning and adapting to stay secure.",10.6,41.77,12.8,12.5,10.87,14.72,5.38,10.714285714285714
