Here is a 100-word paragraph about 'nutrition' written at the Research level:

Nutrition refers to the biochemical process by which organisms acquire and utilize nutrients to sustain life. This complex process involves the ingestion, digestion, absorption, and utilization of nutrients from food sources, which are then converted into energy and other essential molecules. Nutrient intake affects physiological functions, growth, and development, and inadequate or excessive intake can lead to various health disorders. Understanding nutrition requires a multidisciplinary approach, incorporating knowledge from biochemistry, physiology, genetics, and epidemiology. Research in nutrition has significant implications for public health policy, disease prevention, and personalized medicine.
