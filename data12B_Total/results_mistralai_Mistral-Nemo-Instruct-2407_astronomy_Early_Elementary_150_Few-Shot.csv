Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?""

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Example 3:
A child looks up at the night sky. Many stars shine in the dark. The stars twinkle. They are far away from Earth. Some stars are alone. Others are in groups, like families. The child asks, ""Are those stars planets?"" No, those are not planets. Planets are closer to Earth. They look like stars but are bigger. Some planets have moons. The child asks, ""Can I see the Moon?"" Yes, the Moon is easy to see. It is the bright, round shape in the sky. The Moon is not a star. It is a planet too, but it is special. It is the only planet we can walk on. Isn't that amazing?",1.4,97.91,1.2,5.9,3.89,1.98,2.42,2.1875

Astronomy is like looking at the sky. We see many, many stars. Stars are like tiny suns, but far away. They shine at night. Some stars are close together. They make patterns called constellations. You can see these patterns in the sky. They look like pictures. Some look like animals or things on Earth. For example, you can see a big bear called Ursa Major.

Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?"" But the owl says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the goose. Maybe it is her egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the goose. They ask the goose, ""Is this your egg?"" But the goose says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the two ducks. Maybe it is their egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the two ducks. They ask the two ducks, ""Is this your egg?"" But the two ducks say, ""No, that is not our egg."" Then the egg breaks.

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'astronomy' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 150 words. Let's assume the target sentence should include the phrase 'Look at the stars!'

Example 3:
At night, when it is dark, look at the stars! They are tiny, shiny dots in the sky. We cannot touch them, but we can see them. Some stars are close to Earth. Others are far, far away. Even the closest star is very, very far from us. You cannot walk to the stars. You need a spaceship. Many people study stars. They are called astronomers. They use big telescopes to look at stars. Some stars are red. Others are blue. Some stars are bigger than our Sun. They are called giant stars. Look at the stars! They are beautiful and full of secrets.",1.4,97.91,1.5,5.9,3.82,2.33,2.41,2.1875
