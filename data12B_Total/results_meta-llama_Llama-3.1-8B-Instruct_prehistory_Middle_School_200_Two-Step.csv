Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 200 words. Prehistory is the period of human history before the advent of written records. It includes all the time before the invention of writing, which is usually dated back to around 5,000 years ago in Mesopotamia. During this time, humans developed from a common ancestor with other primates, and over time, they spread across the globe, migrating to different continents and adapting to various environments. Prehistory is typically divided into three broad periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic period is characterized by the use of stone tools and the development of early human societies. The Mesolithic period saw the development of more complex societies and the use of more sophisticated tools. The Neolithic period is marked by the domestication of plants and animals, which led to the development of settled agriculture and the emergence of more complex societies.

## Step 1: Identify the main topic and key concepts
The main topic is ""Prehistory"" and the key concepts include the period before written records, the development of humans from a common ancestor, the spread of humans across the globe, the division of prehistory into three periods, and the use of archaeological evidence to understand prehistory.

## Step 2: Simplify the language and sentence structure
To match the readability level of Middle School, the language and sentence structure should be simplified. This includes using shorter sentences, avoiding complex vocabulary, and using more straightforward explanations.

Prehistory is the time before people kept written records. This period started when the first humans appeared and ended when people invented writing. It's divided into three stages: the Old Stone Age, Middle Stone Age, and New Stone Age. During this time, humans made tools, learned language, and formed communities. They hunted and gathered food and later started farming. People also discovered fire, the wheel, and other important inventions that helped them progress. As humans moved and settled in different parts of the world, they developed unique cultures and societies. When writing was invented, recorded history began. Prehistory is a fascinating period that archaeologists and anthropologists have studied to learn about our ancient ancestors. This time period has helped us understand how humans evolved and lived.

As people's societies got more complex, they entered the Mesolithic Era, where they started settling in one place and making better tools.
In the Neolithic Era, people began farming, which allowed for bigger communities. They also built permanent homes and developed social structures.
The Bronze Age marked the start of using metal tools and the growth of more complex societies with leaders, economies, and social classes. This was also the time when writing first appeared, ending prehistory and starting history. [200 words]  ]]>
