Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

Prehistory is the time before people could write things down. It's like going back to when the first humans were on Earth, around 2.6 million years ago. During prehistory, people didn't live in cities or towns. They were hunters and gatherers, meaning they found food by hunting animals and gathering plants. They moved around a lot, following the animals and seasons. They didn't have tools like we do now. Instead, they used things they found in nature, like stones for cutting or wooden sticks for digging. It's a fascinating period, full of discoveries about how our ancestors lived and adapted to their environment.",10.1,53.71,11.2,12.7,10.64,10.79,4.8,15.25

Prehistory is the time before humans started recording their history in writing. It began about 3.3 million years ago, when our early human ancestors first appeared. These ancient people did not leave behind written records, so we rely on clues from archaeology and anthropology to understand their way of life. Archaeologists study the tools, art, and other artifacts they left behind, while anthropologists examine their bones and DNA. This helps us learn about the earliest human societies, their cultures, and how they adapted to their environments. Prehistory ended around 3300 BCE, when the first civilizations began to develop and create written records.",10.5,52.6,12.2,13.3,11.57,11.72,5.14,15.25

Prehistory is the time before written records, when humans didn't keep books or write letters. It's like when you were a kid, and you didn't know how to read or write yet.

The paragraph should introduce the concept of prehistory, mention one important event, and briefly describe one archaeological discovery. Prehistory is the period of time before written records were created, so there are no direct accounts of events. Archaeologists use clues from the past to learn about this time.

Prehistory, a time before written records, stretches back to the dawn of humanity. One significant event was the shift from nomadic hunter-gatherer lifestyles to settled agriculture. Around 10,000 years ago, in the Fertile Crescent, early humans began domesticating plants and animals, a transformation that still echoes today. In the realm of archaeological discoveries, the Lascaux Cave in France offers a vivid window into prehistory.

Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

The calculator automatically follows the conventional order of operations. 
You can setup your calculator to work either in natural display or linear display. Natural display causes fractions, irrational numbers, expressions, and certain functions to be displayed as you see them on paper. Linear display causes fractions and other expressions to be displayed in a line. 
When we come across an expression such as 7 + 3 ÷ 10 × 1, it makes a difference how we choose which operations to perform first.
Scientific calculators have been programmed to follow preset mathematical rules. If we press the buttons in a certain order, the calculator does the operations according to the rules that it has been programmed with.

Prehistory is the time before written history, when people left no written records. It's the age of early humans, like the Neanderthals and Homo erectus. These people didn't have books or newspapers, so we can't read about their lives directly. Archaeologists study their tools, art, and remains to understand how they lived. Prehistory is a fascinating era, full of mystery and discovery. It's a time when humans first began to shape the world around them.",10.5,52.6,11.7,13.2,11.12,11.08,4.96,15.25

Prehistory is the time period before written records were kept. Prehistory is divided into three eras: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. The Stone Age is further divided into three periods: the Paleolithic, the Mesolithic, and the Neolithic.

Prehistory, the vast era before written records, is divided into three main periods: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. The Stone Age, the longest and most intriguing of these eras, is further broken down into three distinct periods. It all began with the Paleolithic, a time when our early human ancestors, known as hominids, first started to use stone tools. These tools, crude but functional, were the first evidence of human evolution and intelligence. As the",11.0,51.48,12.7,13.6,11.86,11.26,5.17,15.25

- Mention a prehistory site
- Provide some detail about what has been found at the site

Prehistory is the time before written history. This means it's the period before people started recording events in books or on tablets. In prehistory, we learn about people's lives through what they left behind, like tools, art, and homes. One famous prehistory site is Stonehenge in England. It's a circle of big stones, set up around 3000 years ago. Archaeologists, who study these sites, found tools, bones, and even human remains here. This helps us understand how people lived, what they ate, and even how they died during prehistory.",10.8,51.89,12.1,13.0,10.91,11.08,5.07,15.25
