Limit the output to 100 words.,,"Generate a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting readability level Graduate. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex, multifaceted process characterized by progressive functional decline and increased susceptibility to diseases. It is influenced by both intrinsic genetic factors and extrinsic environmental factors, including lifestyle choices. This process involves a decline in various physiological systems, such as the cardiovascular, respiratory, and immune systems, leading to a decreased ability to maintain homeostasis and respond to stress.",15.3,13.34,16.4,14.8,17.01,18.44,7.67,12.0

Limit the output to 100 words.,,"Generate a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting readability level Graduate. Limit the output to 100 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process influenced by both intrinsic and extrinsic factors. Intrinsically, our DNA's telomeres shorten over time due to cell division, and mutations accumulate, leading to cellular senescence and dysfunction. Extrinsically, environmental factors like oxidative stress, inflammation, and poor nutrition accelerate aging. Research suggests that caloric restriction, exercise, and certain medications may slow aging by modulating these processes. However, no single intervention has been proven to halt or reverse aging entirely, and more research is needed to fully understand and combat age-related diseases.",13.8,22.51,16.0,15.0,16.73,17.74,6.82,11.285714285714286
