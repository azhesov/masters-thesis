The prehistoric era is divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. During the Paleolithic period, early humans roamed the earth in search of food and shelter. They developed simple tools, such as stone knives and clubs, to aid in their survival. As humans migrated to different parts of the world, they encountered various environments and adapted to them, leading to the development of new technologies and cultures.

Prehistory is the period of time before written records existed. It begins when the first humans appeared on Earth and continues until the invention of writing. During this time, humans developed tools, language, and social structures. They also began to domesticate plants and animals, leading to the development of agriculture. This allowed for the growth of settled communities, which eventually gave rise to cities and civilizations. Prehistory is often divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic period is characterized by the use of stone tools and the hunting and gathering of food. The Mesolithic period saw the development of more complex tools and the beginning of settled communities. The Neolithic period is marked by the domestication of plants and animals and the development of agriculture.

Here is the final answer to the problem: 

The period before written records began is called prehistory. This era covers the time when humans first emerged and developed into various societies and cultures. During prehistory, early humans lived in small groups, hunted for food, and gathered plants. As societies grew, they developed tools, learned to farm, and domesticated animals. This era saw the rise and fall of many civilizations, such as ancient Mesopotamia, Egypt, and China. The study of prehistory is based on archaeological findings, which include artifacts, tools, and other evidence of past human activities. By examining these remains, historians can reconstruct the lives and cultures of ancient societies and gain a deeper understanding of human history. The prehistoric period is a fascinating and complex subject that continues to captivate historians and the general public alike. Its study provides a unique window into the lives of our ancestors and helps us understand how human societies evolved over time.

Prehistory is the period before recorded history. It is the time before written records. This time was long ago, before people wrote things down. People lived, but they did not write about their lives. There are not many records of this time. Archaeologists study things from this time to learn about it. They find old tools, buildings, and other things that people made. They use these things to figure out how people lived. It is a way to learn about the past, even though there are no written records.

Prehistory is a term that refers to the period of time before written records. This means that we cannot find out about the past by reading books or documents. Instead, archaeologists use other methods such as excavating sites, analyzing artifacts, and studying the natural environment to learn about the past. They can tell what people ate, how they lived, and what they believed in by looking at the tools they used and the things they left behind. By studying prehistory, we can gain a better understanding of how human societies developed and changed over time.

Step 1: 
The first step is to think about how to explain 'prehistory' in 150 words. Prehistory refers to the time period before written records existed. It's a fascinating era that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of writing. During this time, our ancestors developed complex societies, harnessed new technologies, and created art and artifacts that still captivate us today. Despite the lack of written records, archaeologists and anthropologists use various methods to reconstruct the past, including analyzing artifacts, studying rock art, and excavating ancient sites. By examining these clues, we can gain a deeper understanding of the lives and cultures of our prehistoric ancestors. This period is essential to understanding human history, and its study continues to shed new light on our collective past.

The Mesolithic Age saw the emergence of more sophisticated tools and social structures. In the Neolithic Age, people began to domesticate plants and animals, leading to the development of settled agriculture. As civilizations grew, so did the complexity of societies, leading to the eventual development of written records. The study of prehistory is essential to understanding human evolution and the origins of modern societies.
