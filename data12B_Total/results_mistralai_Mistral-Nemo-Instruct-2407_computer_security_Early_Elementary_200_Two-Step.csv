Computer security, also known as information security, is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and sensitive data from digital threats, damage, or unauthorized access. It encompasses various aspects, including confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Confidentiality ensures that data is accessed only by authorized individuals, while integrity maintains the accuracy and completeness of data over its entire lifecycle. Availability guarantees timely and reliable access to and use of information. Key areas in computer security include access control, authentication, incident response, and encryption. Access control regulates who can access what resources, while authentication verifies the identity of users, systems, or devices. Incident response involves detecting, responding to, and recovering from security breaches. Encryption transforms readable data into an unreadable format, preventing unauthorized access even if intercepted. Other crucial components include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and secure software development practices. Regular updates, patches, and user awareness are also vital for maintaining robust computer security.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Early Elementary and limit the output to 200 words:
