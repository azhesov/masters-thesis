Prehistory is the period of human history before the advent of writing, beginning with the emergence of Homo sapiens in Africa and extending to the beginning of recorded history. It is a time of significant cultural, social, and technological development, marked by the emergence of complex societies, the development of agriculture, and the creation of tools and art. Prehistoric humans lived in various environments, including forests, deserts, and tundras, and developed unique adaptations to their surroundings. The prehistoric period is typically divided into several stages, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras, each characterized by distinct cultural and technological developments.

Prehistory refers to the period of time before written records were kept, typically from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. During this time, humans lived in small nomadic groups, hunting and gathering food, and later developing more complex societies. Prehistory is divided into several periods, including the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age). These periods saw significant changes in human culture, technology, and society, such as the development of tools, language, and agriculture. The earliest human societies were likely small, tribal, and nomadic, with limited social and economic complexity. As human populations grew and became more complex, so did their societies, leading to the development of more sophisticated tools, social structures, and eventually, writing.

The period of prehistory spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. Characterized by a lack of written records, prehistory encompasses the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras. These periods witnessed significant advancements in human culture, technology, and society, including the development of tools, language, and agriculture. Early human societies likely consisted of small, tribal groups with limited social and economic complexity. As populations grew and became more complex, so did their societies, leading to the emergence of more sophisticated tools, social structures, and eventually, written records. The end of prehistory marks the beginning of recorded history, where written accounts become a primary source of information. This period laid the groundwork for the development of complex societies and the emergence of human civilizations.
