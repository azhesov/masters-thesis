Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Use the word 'prehistory' in the sentence.
Step 4: Review your paragraph to make sure it is at the correct reading level and contains the word 'prehistory'.

Step 1: To explain 'prehistory' to an Early Elementary reader, we should focus on the idea that it's a time before written records, when people used tools and had stories, but we can't read about them directly.

Step 2: Appropriate vocabulary for an Early Elementary reader could include: 'long time ago', 'before', 'people', 'tools','stories', 'write','read'. Sentence structure should be simple and short.

Step 3: ""A long time ago, before people could write, there was a time called 'prehistory'. In those days, people used tools and had stories. We can't read about them directly, but we can learn about them through other ways.""

Step 4: The paragraph uses simple sentence structure and appropriate vocabulary,",7.8,65.01,10.4,9.7,7.02,10.26,3.64,8.833333333333334

In prehistory, people lived long ago, before we had written words. They were hunters and gatherers, finding food in nature. Imagine: no schools, no cars, no computers!

Step 4: Review your paragraph. Check that it follows your plan, uses appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure, and is accurate.

I think my paragraph is accurate. I used simple vocabulary like 'long ago', 'hunters', and 'gatherers'. I explained prehistory in a way that a child can understand, by comparing it to something they might be familiar with - no schools, no cars, no computers. I also made sure to include the main idea, that people in prehistory lived before written words.",7.9,59.5,8.5,10.4,7.86,9.9,3.68,5.3

Step 4: Read your paragraph aloud to yourself. Make sure it is easy to understand and engaging.

**Step 1:**
To explain 'prehistory' to an Early Elementary level reader, we need to make it relatable and simple. We can think of it as the time before people started writing things down, so they didn't have books or schools like we do now.

**Step 2:**
Appropriate vocabulary could include: long ago, early humans, daily life, hunt, gather, make, use. We can use simple, short sentences and descriptive verbs to engage the reader.

**Step 3:**
Long ago, early humans lived in a world full of nature. They didn't have stores to buy food. Instead, they spent their days hunting animals and gathering fruits and vegetables. They made their own tools and clothes using what they found in the world around them. Life was",6.2,74.69,8.3,9.0,7.52,8.69,3.74,6.375

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Make sure to include all the key ideas from Step 1.

Prehistory is the time before people wrote things down. It's like when your teacher asks you to draw a picture of your family, but you can't write their names. Imagine way, way back, when no one could write yet. That's prehistory! People lived, animals roamed, and the Earth changed, but we don't have books or newspapers from that time. Archaeologists, like detectives, find clues to help us understand what life was like in prehistory. They study bones, tools, and even rocks to solve the mystery of our ancient past.",6.2,74.59,8.2,9.6,8.09,8.92,3.77,6.25

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Here's a model paragraph:

""Long ago, before we had writing or calendars, people lived on Earth. This time is called 'prehistory.' In prehistory, people didn't have cars, computers, or schools. They hunted animals and gathered plants for food. They made tools from bones, stones, and wood. Prehistory ended about 5,000 years ago when people started writing things down.""

Step 4: Check your paragraph for appropriate vocabulary, sentence structure, and accuracy of information.

Step 5: Repeat this process to create a second paragraph that is a continuation of the first. Here's a model paragraph:

""People in prehistory lived in small groups called tribes. They moved around a lot, following animals and looking for food. They didn't have clothes like we do now. Instead, they wore animal skins. They also made shelters from things they found in nature, like leaves and branches.""",6.4,68.77,8.8,9.4,7.13,10.42,3.61,5.0
