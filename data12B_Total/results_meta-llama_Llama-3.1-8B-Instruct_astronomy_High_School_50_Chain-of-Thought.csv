## Step 1: Think about how to explain 'astronomy' to someone reading at the High School level.
To explain astronomy to a High School reader, I should consider what they already know and what they are likely to be interested in learning. This means using terms that are familiar to them and avoiding overly technical jargon unless necessary.

## Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For a High School audience, vocabulary should be clear and not too complex. Sentences should be structured in a way that is easy to follow, making it simple for the reader to understand the concepts being presented.
