Prehistory is the time before written history, when people didn't leave written records. It's like a big puzzle where scientists use clues from rocks, bones, and tools to understand how early humans lived. These clues help us learn about their homes, food, and even how they thought and behaved.",7.3,66.54,10.4,10.8,9.52,11.64,4.26,7.4

In the story of human history, prehistory is the very first chapter. It begins about 7 million years ago when the first humans, called hominids, appeared in Africa. These early humans were similar to today's apes. Over time, they learned to walk upright, use tools, and create simple shelters. This period ended around 5,000 years ago when writing was invented, allowing humans to record their history.",7.9,59.4,9.7,10.6,9.58,11.53,5.0,6.642857142857143
