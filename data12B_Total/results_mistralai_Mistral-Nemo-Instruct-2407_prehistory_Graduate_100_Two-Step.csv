Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 100 words. Prehistory is the period before written records, spanning from the origin of the universe to the invention of writing. It's divided into four main eras: Cosmic (birth of the universe), Solar (formation of the solar system), Geologic (emergence of Earth), and Biologic (appearance of life). The term 'prehistory' was coined in the 19th century to describe the time before history, as history is typically defined by the availability of written records.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Graduate and limit the output to 100 words:
