In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

As we age, our body undergoes inevitable changes. A coal might say, 'If I hadn't escaped the fire, I'd be ash.' Similarly, a human's cells start to decline. Our skin wrinkles, hair turns gray, and physical strength fades. Without a 'hot air' of self-care, we'd burn out. The process takes time, but like the veneer, we must adapt.  - edited for 50 words limit.

Human aging is like a burning fire that consumes everything in its path. Our cells, like the straw, begin to wither away. Our energy, like the coal, starts to dwindle. Our experiences, like the beans, become a broth of memories. Our time is limited; we must cherish each moment. ​
Example 3:
During the last year of my life, I lived in a village. My home was a small wooden hut on the outskirts of the village. The hut was surrounded by a garden filled with a variety of vegetables, fruits, and flowers. The garden was a place of peace and solace for me. I spent most of my days tending to the garden, watching the plants grow, and enjoying the beauty of nature. The garden was a reminder of the simple joys of life, and it brought me a sense of contentment and happiness.

As we age, our skin loses its moisture and becomes dry, like the bean on the ground. A burning coal of stress can jump into our lives, and a straw of vitality may ask: ""How do we come to this dry stage?"" We must maintain a healthy life, like the hot air in the dry room, to keep our aging process moving steadily.  If not, we may end up like the straw, brittle and weak.

Here’s a quick example of a paragraph with 165 words:
""Human aging is a process that occurs in our bodies. A variety of physical changes occur. A person’s body undergoes a process of cellular deterioration. This is due to the gradual decline of cellular functions. A human body's cells deteriorate over time. This results in wrinkles, gray hair, and age spots. This can also lead to a decline in physical abilities and health issues. The brain's capacity for processing information may decrease. This can result in memory loss and cognitive decline.

Human aging is a natural process. Like a straw that burns, our bodies wear out. If we don’t take care of them, we might ‘burn out’ faster. Exercise and a healthy diet are like coal – they help us keep going. Eating well is like the bean – we want to make the most of our time. Aging is inevitable, but with good habits, we can make the most of it.  Our bodies are like the veneer - we must take care of them to last a long time.  A good life is like the dry room – it requires a controlled temperature and care to last a long time.  If we take care of ourselves, we can stay healthy and strong.  Aging is like the hot air in the dry room – it can be uncomfortable, but it is a natural part of life.  We must learn to adapt to it and make the most of our time.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels.

Human skin cells are lost and replaced daily. If left unattended, they accumulate, and wrinkles form. Like the straw, if not protected, skin can age rapidly. The constant use of protective measures, such as sunscreen, can help prevent premature aging, much like the bean escaping the pot. 

Note:

As we age, our bodies are like logs on a lathe, being cut and shaped by time. Our physical strength, like the wood, is shaved away, while our wisdom, like the dry wood, becomes more durable and valuable with age. Our lives are like crates, with each experience separate, but together creating a unique person. As the heat of life's challenges hits us, we can't escape, but we can choose to make the most of it and emerge stronger, like the dried wood, ready to face the world. We become more refined, like the wood that has been worked with a skilled hand. The passage of time is like the blower that keeps the hot air of life moving, sometimes taking it away, but always replacing it with new air. In the end, we are like the beautiful piece of furniture made from the carefully crafted wood, valuable and useful, with a story to tell.

*   I removed unnecessary words and phrases.
*   I rephrased sentences to make them shorter and clearer.

As humans age, a part of them, like a straw, slowly fades away. Their physical bodies, like the coal, are worn down by time and eventually turn to dust. Their memories, like the bean, are lost without mercy. But with every year, their wisdom and experiences, like the hot air, grow, and their life becomes more rich and fulfilling.
