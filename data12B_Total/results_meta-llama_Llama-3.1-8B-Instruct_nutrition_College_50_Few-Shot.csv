Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:

Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war.

Nutrition is a science that studies the way people eat to stay healthy. Proper nutrition helps the body grow and function correctly. Malnutrition is when the body doesn't get enough nutrients, leading to sickness or weight loss. Nutritionists study how foods affect health, advising people on balanced diets.  The goals of nutrition and healthy eating suggest different dietary guidelines, entailing a tradeoff between weight loss and nutrition adequacy.  Proper nutrition helps the body grow and function correctly, but the goals of weight loss and nutrition adequacy suggest different dietary guidelines, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims.  Armed nutrition, or a proactive approach to nutrition, involves making healthy food choices to maintain a healthy weight and overall well-being.

Nutritional armed neutrality involves being prepared to counteract any imbalance with a varied intake of foods. This state ensures the body is shielded against incursions of malnutrition.

It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.
