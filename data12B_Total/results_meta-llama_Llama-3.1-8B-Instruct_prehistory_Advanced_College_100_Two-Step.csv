This era is typically divided into three phases: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. During this time, early humans developed sophisticated tools, language, and social structures. They transitioned from a nomadic, hunter-gatherer lifestyle to one that incorporated agriculture and animal domestication. The prehistoric period laid the groundwork for the emergence of complex societies and the development of early technologies, ultimately shaping the course of modern human civilizations. Ongoing research continues to refine our understanding of this pivotal era. [Note: Dates vary by region and definition.] [References",11.6,44.44,13.8,13.9,11.95,12.88,5.33,8.428571428571429
