In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Example 2:
From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

If you were to fall into a stream, you would struggle to swim and eventually get tired and drown. Similarly, human bodies struggle as they age and eventually succumb to death. At first, our cells regenerate rapidly, just like the veneer in the drying rooms, where it is heated and kept in motion. However, as we get older, our cells slow down, and the body becomes more vulnerable to damage. Our skin becomes dry, our muscles weaken, and our organs start to fail. It's as if the fire in our cells has dwindled, and we're left struggling to stay afloat in a world that keeps moving.

As we grow up, we are like a handful of beans – our lives are full of potential and vitality. But, like the old woman's beans, we face a burning fire – time – that tries to burn us out. If we are not careful, we will be consumed by its heat, and our energy will be reduced to nothing. However, if we can escape the heat, like the coal that jumped out of the fire, we can live longer, and our bodies will stay healthy and strong. Our lifespan is the result of our choices and how we manage our time.

Our bodies, like old furniture, gradually become worn and weathered with time. One day, a spark of life, like a burning coal, ignites within us. As we age, our cells begin to weaken, much like a wooden beam that has been exposed to the elements. If we don't take care of ourselves, we risk being ""burnt to ashes,"" our vitality dwindling until we're nothing but a shadow of our former selves. But just as a piece of wood can be restored with care and attention, our bodies can be rejuvenated with healthy habits and self-care. It's up to us to preserve our ""veneer"" and maintain our youthful spirit.​

Human aging is a natural process that affects every person. It starts from the day we are born. Our cells divide and multiply, and over time they begin to weaken and break down. The skin loses its elasticity, wrinkles form, and our bodies start to slow down. If we are lucky, we may live a long and healthy life. But eventually, our bodies will reach the end of their lifespan. The human body is like the straw in the example, eventually burning out from the fires of life. We all must come to terms with aging and the inevitable end of our time on this earth. It is a process we all must face.  This text will be assessed based on the following criteria:
- Vocabulary: Using words like ""natural"", ""weaken"", ""elasticity"", ""wrinkles"", ""slowing down"", and ""lifespan"" will help assess the student's vocabulary skills.

As we grow older, our bodies are like a dish of beans, slowly cooking in the pan of life. One day, a burning desire for adventure may leap from our inner fire, prompting us to take a leap of faith and pursue our dreams. Like a bean that has escaped the pan, we may feel free and exhilarated, but also uncertain about our future. If we don't take risks, our lives may be dull and unfulfilling, like a piece of straw that has burned up without making a mark. But if we seize the day, our lives can be rich and meaningful.  - end of paragraph.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Human aging is a natural process where our bodies change over time. If we don't take care of ourselves, our bodies might become weak like the straw that helped start the fire. We might get hurt or sick like the bean that nearly fell into the hot pan. But, just like the coal that escaped the fire, we can take control of our lives and make healthy choices to stay safe. We can exercise, eat well, and get enough sleep to keep our bodies strong and healthy. This way, we can live long and happy lives. Aging is a natural process, but it's up to us to take care of ourselves.

""As we age, our bodies undergo changes like those in the examples. Just as the bean escaped being boiled alive, our cells start to break down, but some manage to'survive' by adapting to the stress.

We are all born with a spark of life, a vital energy that makes us live. But as time passes, our bodies begin to lose that spark. Our cells start to decline, and our vital energy starts to fade. Our skin wrinkles and our muscles weaken. If we don't take care of ourselves, we become like a coal that has been burnt to ashes. But, just as a bean can escape the old woman's pan and a straw can survive the fire, our bodies can be preserved with a healthy lifestyle, allowing us to live a long and fulfilling life.

It uses sentence structures from the examples, such as the use of metaphors (""a spark of life""), similes (""like a coal that has been burnt to ashes""), and cause-and-effect relationships (""if we don't take care of ourselves, we become..."").

Aging is like a burning fire, which if not controlled, can lead to a complete loss of strength and vitality. It starts with a spark of youth, where we are full of energy and life. But just as a coal jumps from the flames, aging can cause a sudden loss of vitality. A bean falls into the pan of life, and before we know it, we are cooked, old, and ready to be discarded. Like a straw, we are fragile and can easily break, losing our purpose and identity. However, just as a veneer is dried and preserved, we can slow down aging by taking care of our bodies and minds.  (Note: I modified the last sentence to make it relevant and more accurate.)
