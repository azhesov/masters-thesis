Computer security, often abbreviated as InfoSec, is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and sensitive data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. It involves a set of technologies, processes, and policies designed to safeguard digital assets and prevent cyber threats. The main goal of computer security is to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information systems and data.
Effective computer security requires a combination of technical, physical, and administrative controls. Technical controls include firewalls, intrusion detection systems, and encryption methods. Physical controls involve securing devices and equipment, such as using secure storage and limiting access to sensitive areas. Administrative controls involve establishing policies, procedures, and guidelines for user behavior and system maintenance. Additionally, computer security requires ongoing monitoring and incident response planning to address potential threats and minimize their impact.
Computer security is a critical aspect of modern life, as it protects not only individual computers but also entire networks, organizations, and governments from cyber threats. The consequences of",15.2,13.44,16.3,15.5,15.75,18.27,6.74,12.5

Computer security, also known as cybersecurity, is the practice of protecting a computer system, network, or data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This includes protection from both physical and digital threats. Firewalls are a crucial component of computer security, acting as a barrier between a trusted network and an untrusted network, such as the internet. Encryption, on the other hand, is the process of converting plaintext into unreadable ciphertext to prevent unauthorized access to sensitive information. Access controls, including passwords, biometric authentication, and access lists, are used to limit access to authorized personnel and systems. Network security protocols, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), ensure secure communication between devices over a network. Intrusion detection systems (IDS) monitor network traffic for signs of unauthorized access or malicious activity, alerting",13.7,28.33,16.4,15.4,14.92,16.88,6.35,10.857142857142858
