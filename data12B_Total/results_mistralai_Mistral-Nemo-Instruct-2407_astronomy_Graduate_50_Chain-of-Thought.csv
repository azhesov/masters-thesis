Astronomy, a branch of physics, is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It encompasses the vastness of space, from the nearest stars to the farthest galaxies, exploring their physical and chemical properties, origins, and evolution. Astronomy employs electromagnetic radiation across the spectrum to observe these objects, making it a multidisciplinary field that intersects with physics, chemistry, and mathematics.",12.4,37.0,14.3,14.1,14.52,14.67,5.91,11.833333333333334

Final paragraph:
""In the realm of astronomy, the Graduate student delves into the cosmic arena, exploring celestial bodies, their origins, and interactions. They scrutinize stellar evolution, galaxy formation, and the cosmic microwave background. Utilizing advanced mathematical models and cutting-edge technology, such as radio telescopes and space-based observatories, they unravel the mysteries of the universe, contributing to our understanding of its vast, ever-evolving tapestry.""",11.1,40.45,13.1,12.5,12.6,14.61,5.55,6.333333333333333

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 50 words that follows your plan. Remember that you should not use 'astronomy' or any form of it in your explanation.

Step 1: To explain the study of celestial objects and phenomena to a graduate reader, I'll use descriptive language and avoid the term 'astronomy'.
Step 2: I'll employ words like 'cosmic','stellar', 'galactic', and 'celestial' to convey the subject matter. I'll also use verbs like 'investigate', 'examine', 'observe', and 'analyze' to describe the actions taken in this field.
Step 3: Here's a 50-word paragraph: ""Cosmic researchers investigate stellar bodies and galactic structures, examining their formation, evolution, and interactions. They analyze light spectra, observe celestial movements, and interpret data to unravel the mysteries of the universe.""",10.7,46.78,13.2,13.4,12.79,12.93,5.6,8.714285714285714
