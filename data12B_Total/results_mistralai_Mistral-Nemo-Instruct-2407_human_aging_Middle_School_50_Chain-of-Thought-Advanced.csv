Human aging is a natural process where our bodies change over time. As we get older, our cells divide less, and we lose muscle and bone. Our senses weaken, and we become more prone to diseases. This process starts in our 20s and speeds up after 60. It's a part of life, but understanding it helps us stay healthy longer.",6.9,67.45,7.7,8.8,7.1,8.45,4.03,6.625

Step 4: Follow your plan and write the final paragraph. Here it is:

""Human aging is the gradual process of our bodies changing over time. It begins at birth and continues until death. As we grow older, our cells slow down in reproduction, we lose muscle and bone, and our organs become less efficient. This makes us more prone to diseases and injuries. Scientists are still learning about why and how this happens.""",6.4,68.87,7.8,8.8,7.41,9.09,4.48,4.9

Step 4: Follow your plan and write the final paragraph. The paragraph should start with 'Human aging is...'.

Human aging is the progressive physical and mental decline that occurs over time. As we age, our cells divide more slowly, and we become more susceptible to diseases. Our skin wrinkles, our bones weaken, and our muscles lose strength. Our brains also change, making it harder to learn new things and remember information. This process is influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and environment. It's a natural part of life, but it can be slowed down through healthy habits and medical advancements.",6.4,68.67,9.0,9.6,8.29,10.3,4.39,4.9

""As time passes, our cells accumulate DNA damage from aging. Over time, this damage builds up, causing our bodies to decline. Scientists believe this process starts around age 35, when our cells can no longer repair DNA as efficiently.""",6.4,68.87,8.5,8.4,6.9,9.38,4.07,5.333333333333333
