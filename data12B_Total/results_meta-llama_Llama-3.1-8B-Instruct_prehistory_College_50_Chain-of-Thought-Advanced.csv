The prehistory of a culture or region is the period of time before written records exist. This time span includes early human societies, which developed in various parts of the world. The prehistory of a culture can be divided into three main stages: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. The Paleolithic period, which lasted from approximately 2.6 million to 10,000 years ago, is characterized by the use of stone tools and early human migration. The Mesolithic period, spanning from 10,000 to 5,000 years ago, saw the development of more complex societies and the use of microliths. The Neolithic period, which began around 5,000 years ago, is marked by the introduction of agriculture and the domestication of animals. Understanding prehistory is essential for reconstructing the past and understanding the evolution of human societies.

Prehistory refers to the period before written records began, which includes the entire human history prior to the invention of writing. It spans from the emergence of the first humans, approximately 300,000 years ago, to the development of writing systems, around 5,000 years ago. During this time, human societies evolved and developed complex cultures, languages, and technologies, often leaving behind tangible archaeological evidence of their existence. Prehistory is a crucial period for understanding the origins of modern societies and the trajectory of human development. The study of prehistory allows us to reconstruct the lives of our ancestors, their social structures, and their relationships with their environments. By analyzing archaeological sites, artifacts, and other materials, researchers can gain insights into the daily lives, struggles, and achievements of people who lived before the advent of writing.
