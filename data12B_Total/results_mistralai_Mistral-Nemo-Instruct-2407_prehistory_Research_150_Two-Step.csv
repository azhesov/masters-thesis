Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 150 words. Before the invention of writing, human history is known as prehistory. This period spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing, which occurred independently in various regions around 3400 BCE. Prehistory is often divided into three main stages: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. Each stage is characterized by the primary material used for tools and weapons. During the Stone Age, humans relied on stone tools, with the period further divided into the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and Neolithic (New Stone Age) eras. The Bronze Age saw the use of bronze, and the Iron Age marked the use of iron. Artifacts, architecture, and fossil records provide insights into human life during these eras, including diet, culture, and technology. The transition from one stage to another was gradual and varied across different regions, with significant cultural and technological advancements occurring","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Research and limit the output to 150 words:

Research-level rewrite:
Prehistory, encompassing the era preceding written records, spans from the earliest stone tools in the Oldowan period (c. 2.6 Ma) to the inception of writing systems (c. 3400-3200 BCE). This period is segmented into Lower, Middle, Upper Paleolithic, and Mesolithic eras, each characterized by distinct stone tool technologies. Prehistory witnesses the rise and dispersal of Homo sapiens, the evolution of intricate societies, and the domestication of flora and fauna. Archaeological investigation of this epoch relies on the examination of tangible remnants, including artifacts, structures, and fossils. Prehistory offers a comprehensive perspective on the origins and evolution of human culture, technology, and biology.",13.4,28.94,14.9,15.2,13.24,15.54,5.53,10.285714285714286
