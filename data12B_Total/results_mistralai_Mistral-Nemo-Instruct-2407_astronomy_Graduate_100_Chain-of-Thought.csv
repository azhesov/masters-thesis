Astronomy, the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena, is an interdisciplinary field that encompasses physics, mathematics, and chemistry. It explores the origin, evolution, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the properties of celestial bodies and their interactions. Key areas of research include stellar astrophysics, planetary science, and cosmology. Astronomy employs both observational and theoretical methods, with observations typically conducted using ground-based or space-based telescopes. The study of astronomy has significantly advanced our understanding of the universe, from the discovery of exoplanets to the detection of gravitational waves.",12.6,30.97,14.9,14.2,14.92,16.46,6.08,8.125

Astronomy, a branch of physics, focuses on the study of celestial bodies and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It explores the composition, properties, and evolution of objects like stars, planets, galaxies, and black holes. Employing advanced mathematical models and sophisticated observational techniques, astronomers delve into the cosmos to unravel its mysteries and expand our understanding of the universe. Furthermore, astronomy plays a pivotal role in shaping our perception of the cosmos and our place within it, as it challenges our beliefs and inspires us to explore the unknown.

Graduate-level astronomy is an advanced field that builds upon the foundational principles of undergraduate studies. It delves deeper into the complexities of astrophysics, cosmology, and planetary science, preparing students for careers in research, academia, or related industries.
