As Johnson worked on math problems with the other female computers, she would ask questions. She didn't want to just do the work — she wanted to know the ""hows"" and the ""whys,"" and then the ""why nots."" By asking questions, Johnson began to stand out.
Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went. She became known for her training in geometry and began to work with teams made up of men. Eventually, she was recognized as a leader, and the men increasingly relied on her to have the answers they needed.
In 1958, NACA officially became NASA. Shortly thereafter, Johnson became part of the space team. She began calculating the flight path, or trajectory path, for the rocket to put the first American in space in 1961. That American was astronaut Alan Shepard. The engineers knew when and where they wanted Shepard's space capsule to land, but the tricky part was to calculate when and where the rocket would have to launch. Johnson figured it out!

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

When computers first became popular, people didn't think about keeping them safe. They were just excited to use them for games and work. But as more people started using computers, bad people found ways to break into them and cause trouble. This is called a cyber attack. Now, people like computer security experts are in charge of keeping computers safe. They work to figure out how bad people might try to break in, and then they create strong walls to protect computers. These walls are like puzzles that only good people can solve. Computer security experts also teach others how to keep their computers safe, just like Johnson taught the engineers at NASA.",7.0,72.56,8.4,9.9,8.47,8.52,4.14,7.142857142857142

Computer security is like keeping your lunch safe at school. Just as you wouldn't want your friends taking your sandwich without asking, computers don't want viruses or hackers sneaking in. To protect computers, we use passwords and firewalls. A password is like your lunchbox key, keeping others out. A firewall is like the school guard, checking who comes in and out of the computer's'school'. When computers are secure, they can do their work safely, just like you enjoy your lunch without worries.",7.1,72.46,8.9,9.9,8.92,8.99,4.42,7.142857142857142

Computer security is like a secret clubhouse where only the right people can get in. Imagine you have a special password, like a secret knock, to open the clubhouse door. This password is not something you tell everyone, because then anyone could come in! Instead, you keep it safe and only share it with your trusted friends. In the computer world, this secret password is called an ""encryption key."" It helps keep your important information, like your favorite games or photos, safe from people who might want to see them without asking nicely. Just like you wouldn't want someone to take your toys without permission, computers also need protection to keep their valuable information safe. That's where computer security comes in, making sure only the right people can enter the digital clubhouse.",7.2,72.16,8.9,10.1,8.97,8.87,4.24,7.142857142857142

Example 2:
When Naomi saw that Ruth loved her so much, she forgot how tired and hungry she was, and the two journeyed on together until they came to Bethlehem in Judah in the beginning of the barley harvest. There was no famine in Bethlehem. The fields were full of waving grain, and busy servants were reaping it and gathering it up to bind into sheaves. Above all were the fields of the rich man, Boaz, shining with barley and corn.
Naomi and Ruth came to the edge of the fields and watched the busy reapers. They saw that after each sheaf was bound, and each pile of corn was stacked, a little grain fell, unnoticed, to the ground. Ruth said to Naomi: ""Let me go to the field and glean the ears of corn after them."" And Naomi said to her, ""Go, my daughter."" And she went, and came and gleaned in the field after the reapers.

Women were not allowed to attend meetings with the male engineers and scientists. Johnson wanted to go to these meetings to learn more about the projects, so she went.

A computer virus is a malicious software designed to harm or exploit a computer system. It can steal personal information, delete files, or even take control of your computer. To protect against viruses, it's important to have good computer security habits. This means regularly updating your software, using strong passwords, and being cautious about what you download or click on.",7.2,72.16,8.8,10.3,9.28,8.76,4.45,7.142857142857142

Computer security is like a secret club with special rules. Just like in math, you need to follow the rules to stay safe. Codebreakers, crackers, and hackers are like the sneaky kids trying to break into the clubhouse. They use tricks to figure out the secret passwords, or codes, that keep the clubhouse safe. But the club members, or computer users, can protect their clubhouse by making strong passwords and updating their secret rules, or software, regularly. They can also tell if someone is trying to break in by looking for signs, like unusual messages or missing things. So, computer security is all about being smart and staying alert to keep the clubhouse safe from sneaky codebreakers, crackers, and hackers.",7.2,71.95,9.0,9.8,8.96,8.87,4.39,7.142857142857142
