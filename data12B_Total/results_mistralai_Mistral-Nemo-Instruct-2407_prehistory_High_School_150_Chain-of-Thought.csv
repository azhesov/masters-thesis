The term 'prehistory' refers to the time before written records were created, spanning from the emergence of the first humans until the invention of writing. It's like trying to understand a story without any books, only relying on oral traditions and artifacts. For instance, the ancient Sumerian civilization, which existed around 4000 BCE, is considered part of prehistory because their history is known mainly through archaeological findings like ziggurats and cuneiform tablets, rather than contemporary written accounts.",11.3,45.15,13.3,13.3,13.22,13.4,5.55,8.285714285714286

Prehistory, or the time before written history, was a vast period that spanned from the beginning of human existence to the invention of writing. This era was marked by significant events, such as the emergence of early humans in Africa around 6 million years ago and their eventual migration to other parts of the world. During prehistory, humans evolved from early hominids, developed tools and language, and formed complex societies. However, since there were no written records during this time, our knowledge of prehistory comes from archaeological evidence, such as fossils, artifacts, and architectural remains.",9.9,54.22,12.5,12.8,12.09,12.64,5.07,8.285714285714286

**Prehistory** is the period before written records began. This is the time when humans were first developing tools, learning to hunt and gather food, and starting to form communities. The term ""prehistory"" is used because we don't have any written documents from this time. Instead, historians use evidence like fossils, artifacts, and structures to learn about the people who lived during this period. Prehistory started about 3.3 million years ago and ended around 3,000 years ago, depending on the region. It's divided into different periods based on changes in technology, culture, and climate. For example, the Stone Age is a well-known part of prehistory, which is further divided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. Each of these periods shows a different stage of human development and interaction with the environment.",8.6,57.57,10.5,12.0,10.42,11.71,4.61,6.875

In the vast expanse of Earth's timeline, the period before the advent of written records is known as prehistory. This time span stretches from the first emergence of Homo sapiens, our early human ancestors, around 2.5 million years ago, to the invention of writing, which occurred independently in various civilizations between 3400-3200 BCE. During prehistory, human societies were primarily hunter-gatherers, relying on the resources provided by their natural surroundings for survival. This era is often divided into the Stone Age, a broad term that encompasses the entire prehistory, and the Ice Age, a geological period that saw significant climate changes and the spread of early humans across Eurasia and North America. The Stone Age is further divided into the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age",11.5,44.85,13.9,13.2,12.75,13.51,5.57,7.857142857142858

Prehistory is the period before written history began. This means that we can't read about events in books or newspapers. Instead, we learn about this time through archaeology, which is the study of ancient human cultures through the objects they left behind. For example, scientists have discovered tools and weapons made from stone, bone, and wood that are millions of years old! These artifacts tell us about the daily lives of our ancestors and help us understand how humans evolved over time.",7.7,65.42,9.9,11.0,9.75,10.9,4.39,7.0
