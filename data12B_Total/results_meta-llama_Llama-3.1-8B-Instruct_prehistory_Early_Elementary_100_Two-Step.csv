## Step 1: Identify the key points to be rewritten
The key points to be rewritten are: (1) the definition of prehistory, (2) the timeline of prehistory, (3) the evolution of human societies, (4) the stages of prehistory, and (5) the role of archaeological discoveries.

## Step 2: Simplify the language and vocabulary
Use simple language and avoid complex vocabulary that might be difficult for early elementary students to understand. For example, instead of saying ""emergence of the first humans,"" say ""when the first humans appeared.""

Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 100 words. Prehistory refers to the period before written records were kept, typically before the invention of writing. During this time, humans developed from their earliest beginnings as hunter-gatherers to complex societies, including ancient civilizations like Egypt and Mesopotamia. Prehistory is often divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic Era (Stone Age), the Mesolithic Era (Middle Stone Age), and the Neolithic Era (New Stone Age). It spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the development of writing around 5,000 years ago.

The main points of the text are:
- Prehistory is the period before written records were kept.
- Humans developed from hunter-gatherers to complex societies.
- Prehistory is divided into three main periods: Paleolithic Era, Mesolithic Era, and Neolithic Era.
- The prehistoric era spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the development of writing.

## Step 2: Simplify the language and concepts
For Early Elementary level, we need to simplify the language and concepts. For example, ""Paleolithic Era"" can be shortened to ""Stone Age"", and ""Mesolithic Era"" and ""Neolithic Era"" can be described in simpler terms.

## Step 3: Use simpler vocabulary and shorter sentences
Replace complex vocabulary with simpler alternatives. For example,",13.2,34.86,17.7,15.3,13.79,17.11,5.54,11.833333333333334

## Step 2: Simplify the language and vocabulary
To make the text more readable for early elementary students, we need to simplify the language and vocabulary. For example, instead of using the word ""anthropology,"" we can say ""the study of people.""

## Step 3: Shorten the sentences and paragraphs
Early elementary students may have shorter attention spans, so we need to break up the text into shorter sentences and paragraphs.

A long, long time ago, there was no writing. This is called the time before history, or prehistory. It started about 6 million years ago when the first humans appeared. They came from animals called primates. Over time, humans made tools and learned to take care of plants and animals. They also made societies with friends, art, and special ways to believe in things. We know about these people because archaeologists find their things and fossils. They help us understand how humans changed and grew. It's a very interesting time!

Here's a quick look at 'prehistory'. It's the time before we wrote things down. A long time ago, around 2.5 million years ago, humans first appeared. They kept getting better and better at living together in groups. Some of these groups got really good at farming and building homes. We call these groups ancient civilizations. They were special because they were the first to have a lot of people living together in one place. That was a long time ago, around 3,500 years before now. The prehistoric era was a big time of change. People were learning new things and getting better at living together. Posted by [Your Name] on [Current Date] at [Current Time].
