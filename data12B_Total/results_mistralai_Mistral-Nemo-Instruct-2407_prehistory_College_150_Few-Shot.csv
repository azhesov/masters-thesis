Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.

Prehistory refers to the time period before written records began, which is often marked by the emergence of humans and their activities. Prehistoric societies did not have writing systems, so our understanding of this time comes from archaeological evidence, such as artifacts, structures, and human remains. Prehistory is often divided into periods based on these artifacts and the cultural changes they represent. The earliest period, called the Stone Age, is further divided into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras, each characterized by distinct tools and technologies.",14.1,38.05,16.1,15.9,15.29,13.35,6.34,17.75

Prehistory is a term used in the study of human history, referring to the period before written records began. It includes the Stone Age, when humans first appeared, and the Bronze Age, when people started using metal tools. Prehistory covers a vast span of time, from about 3.3 million years ago to around 3000 BCE. During this era, humans migrated across the globe, developing new technologies and adapting to diverse environments. Although we lack written records, archaeologists study artifacts and fossils to understand life in prehistory.",11.9,49.15,14.3,14.6,13.39,12.47,5.81,17.75

Prehistory is the period in the history of humans before the invention of writing. In this time, human societies left no written records, making it difficult for historians to understand their cultures, technologies, and ways of life. Prehistory is further divided into three periods: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age, each characterized by the primary material used for tools and weapons. Archaeologists, who study the physical remains of past human cultures, use artifacts like tools, pottery, and architectural structures to piece together the story of prehistory. This is known as archaeological research, which is crucial in understanding the origins and early development of human societies.",14.0,38.15,15.8,15.8,15.06,13.06,6.26,17.75

Protective tariffs are tariffs that are enacted with the aim of protecting a domestic industry. Tariffs are also imposed in order to raise government revenue, or to reduce an undesirable activity (sin tax). Although a tariff can simultaneously protect domestic industry and earn government revenue, the goals of protection and revenue maximization suggest different tariff rates, entailing a tradeoff between the two aims. 
A tariff is a tax added onto goods imported into a country; protective tariffs are taxes that render the cost of a foreign import higher than the cost of the initially costlier domestic good. For example, if a piece of cloth cost $4 in Britain and $4 in the United States, the American government would have to impose a tariff to make the price of British cloth higher for Americans. The underlying goal for a protective tariff is to protect domestic industry from foreign competition.

Example 2:
Armed neutrality, in international politics, is the posture of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war, but asserts that it will defend itself against resulting incursions from all parties. This may include:
Military preparedness without commitment, especially as the expressed policy of a neutral nation in wartime; readiness to counter with force an invasion of rights by any belligerent power.
Armed neutrality is a term used in international politics, which is the attitude of a state or group of states which makes no alliance with either side in a war. It is the condition of a neutral power, at war, which holds itself ready to resist by force any aggression of either belligerent. Such states assert that they will defend themselves against resulting incursions from all parties.
Neutrality maintained while weapons are kept available.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'prehistory' targeting the same readability level (College), limited to 150 words. Prehistory is the period before written records were kept. It is often divided into several periods based on the development of human culture. During prehistory, humans lived as hunter-gatherers, relying on nature for their survival. They had no writing, so our knowledge of their lives comes from archaeological evidence.",13.2,40.28,14.6,15.0,14.0,12.89,5.99,17.75

Prehistory, a span before written records, is studied by archaeologists and anthropologists. These experts delve into this era to understand human life without the benefit of written accounts. They piece together clues from artifacts, architecture, and cultural practices. This allows them to reconstruct human history from the dawn of Homo sapiens until the advent of written language. Prehistory offers insights into human evolution, societal structures, and technological advancements. It's a window into the past, untainted by written records, providing a raw and authentic view of our ancestors' lives.",12.6,41.9,14.4,14.8,13.46,13.34,5.78,17.75
