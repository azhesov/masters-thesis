In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In prehistory, there were no written records, so we know about this time mostly from fossils and artifacts. Some of the first humans were hominids, who lived in Africa around 6 million years ago. They had a mix of human and ape features. Over time, they evolved into different species, like Homo habilis, who used simple tools, and Homo erectus, who could control fire. They migrated out of Africa, settling in Europe and Asia. Some even reached Australia, which was then connected by land. Life was tough, but these early humans were adaptable and resourceful.",7.8,75.95,9.8,8.7,9.69,7.49,4.77,11.0

In prehistory, people lived before history started. They did not write down their stories. Instead, they made pictures on walls and stones. These pictures show how they lived. They show us they were hunters and gatherers. They hunted animals for food. They gathered plants and fruits. They did not have metal tools. They made tools from stones and bones. They used these tools to hunt and gather food. They also used them to make clothes and shelter. Life was hard. They had to work very hard to survive. They lived in small groups called tribes. They had their own ways of living and telling stories. These ways are now lost to us. But the pictures they left behind help us understand how they lived.",5.8,81.22,7.0,7.7,7.38,7.02,3.82,11.0

They followed animals to kill for food and collected plants to eat. They didn't have homes. They traveled from place to place. They used tools made of stone, wood, and bone. These tools helped them to hunt, gather, and protect themselves. The climate was very different. The weather was unpredictable. Some places were very cold. Other places were very hot. Some people lived in caves. Others built shelters from branches and leaves. Prehistory ended when people began to write. This was about 5,000 years ago.",5.8,81.22,7.5,8.1,7.66,7.48,3.96,11.0

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

In prehistory, people lived long before there were any written records. They did not have books or newspapers. So, we do not know exactly what their lives were like. However, scientists study the things they left behind, like tools and pictures on cave walls. From these, they can guess how people lived. In prehistory, people were hunters and gatherers. They found food by hunting animals and gathering plants. They also made their own tools and weapons. Life was not easy. People had to work hard to survive. There were no stores or farms. If they did not find enough food, they might go hungry. But, they lived in a world full of nature and adventure.",6.5,79.4,7.9,8.5,8.43,7.02,4.13,11.0
