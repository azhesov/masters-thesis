Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Human aging is a complex, multifactorial process characterized by a progressive decline in physiological function and an increased susceptibility to various diseases. It is influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with research suggesting that 25-30% of lifespan is determined by genetics. Key biological pathways implicated in aging include telomere attrition, genomic instability, epigenetic alterations, loss of proteostasis, deregulated nutrient sensing, mitochondrial dysfunction, and inflammation. These hallmarks contribute to the accumulation of cellular damage and the decline of organ function over time. The study of aging is a dynamic field, with ongoing research aiming to understand its mechanisms and develop interventions to promote healthy longevity and improve quality of life in older age.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Research and limit the output to 150 words:

'Human aging' is a complex biological process characterized by progressive functional decline and increased vulnerability to diseases. It's influenced by both genetic and environmental factors, with telomere shortening, cellular senescence, and DNA damage being key molecular drivers. The process varies among individuals, with some people aging faster than others. It's often measured using biomarkers like epigenetic clocks and frailty indices. Interventions aimed at delaying or preventing aging, such as calorie restriction, exercise, and senolytic therapies, are active areas of research. However, there's no consensus on a single cause or cure for aging.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Research and limit the output to 150 words:

Research-level rewrite (150 words):
Human aging is a multifaceted process marked by progressive physiological deterioration and heightened disease susceptibility. It results from intricate interactions between genetic predispositions and environmental influences. Key molecular mechanisms include telomere attrition, cellular senescence, and genomic instability. Individual variability in aging rates exists, necessitating personalized approaches. Biomarkers such as epigenetic clocks and frailty indices facilitate aging research. Interventions targeting aging, including calorie restriction, physical activity, and senolytic therapies, are under investigation. However, a unified causal model or panacea for aging remains elusive. Elucidating human aging is vital for developing strategies to enhance healthy lifespan.",14.5,15.27,16.3,14.1,13.89,18.96,6.09,8.857142857142858

Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by progressive decline in physiological functions, leading to increased vulnerability to diseases and ultimately death. It's influenced by both intrinsic factors (genetics, cellular senescence) and extrinsic factors (environmental, lifestyle).

Write a summary about 'human aging'. Limit the output to 150 words. Human aging is a complex biological process characterized by a progressive decline in physical and mental capabilities over time. It is influenced by a combination of genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors. At the cellular level, aging is associated with changes such as telomere shortening, accumulation of cellular damage, and altered cellular signaling pathways. At the organismal level, aging is marked by a decline in organ function, increased susceptibility to disease, and a higher risk of death. Theories of aging include the free radical theory, which suggests that oxidative damage caused by reactive oxygen species contributes to aging, and the telomere theory, which posits that the shortening of telomeres leads to cellular senescence and thus contributes to aging.
