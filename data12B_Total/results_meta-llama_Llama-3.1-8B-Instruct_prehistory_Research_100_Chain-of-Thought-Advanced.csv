The term 'prehistory' is a concept that refers to the period of time before written records. During this time, human societies were not yet literate and therefore left behind no written accounts of their lives. As a result, our understanding of prehistory relies heavily on archaeological findings, such as artifacts, architecture, and other material remains. These physical remnants provide valuable insights into the cultures, technologies, and ways of life of our ancient ancestors. By studying prehistory, we can gain a deeper appreciation for the evolution of human societies and the complex processes that have shaped our world today.
