Prehistory is the time before written history, so it's before people started writing down events. Archaeologists, who study old stuff, can tell us about this time. They look at things like rocks, tools, and even art on cave walls. These help us know how people lived, what they ate, and how they worked. Prehistory is divided into different periods based on how people lived and what tools they used. The Stone Age is the earliest, where people used stones for tools. Then came the Bronze Age, when people started using metal. After that, the Iron Age, when iron was widely used. So, even though we can't read about it, we can still learn a lot about prehistory!",5.7,76.01,7.5,9.3,7.57,8.69,3.52,6.75

Prehistory is the period before written history began. It's like a big puzzle where we use clues like ancient tools, paintings, and fossils to understand how people lived long ago. Archaeologists are the detectives who solve this puzzle. They study these clues to learn about our ancestors' homes, foods, and even their languages. This period is divided into Stone, Bronze, and Iron Ages. Each age brought new ways of living, like farming instead of hunting.

Prehistory is the time before written records, so it's also called the Stone Age. People then were hunter-gatherers, meaning they found food by hunting animals and gathering plants. They lived in small groups, called tribes, and moved around a lot. They made tools from stones, bones, and wood. Later, around 10,000 years ago, people started farming and making permanent homes, which marks the beginning of recorded history.",6.8,67.76,10.4,10.3,9.09,12.22,4.27,6.571428571428571
