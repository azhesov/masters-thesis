""Prehistory is the time before written history. It starts from the beginning of human life and ends when people began to write things down. This period covers millions of years. In prehistory, people didn't have books or newspapers to learn about the past. Instead, they passed down stories through speech and pictures. Archeologists study prehistory by finding and examining tools, art, and other items left behind by ancient people. This helps us understand how our ancestors lived, hunted, and made tools.""",7.7,60.01,10.0,10.5,8.44,11.93,4.21,6.222222222222222

Prehistory is a fascinating period in our understanding of human history, spanning from the dawn of our earliest ancestors around 6 million years ago to the invention of writing around 3400 BC. During this time, humans evolved from their primate ancestors, migrated across the globe, and developed complex cultures and technologies. This era is often divided into several periods, including the Stone Age, which is further split into the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras. These divisions help us understand the gradual development of human societies, from nomadic hunter-gatherers to settled agricultural communities. Despite the absence of written records, archaeologists and anthropologists have pieced together our prehistory through the study of artifacts, fossils, and the environments in which our ancestors lived. This ongoing detective work continues to reveal the rich tapestry of human history before the advent of writing.",14.4,26.51,15.9,16.2,16.55,15.95,6.46,12.666666666666666

In the context of the human past, prehistory refers to the time before written records. This period spans from the earliest humans, known as Homo habilis, around 2.1 million years ago, to the invention of writing, which occurred independently in various places like Mesopotamia and Egypt around 3400-3200 BCE. During this time, humans evolved, migrated, and developed tools and cultures. The study of prehistory uses archaeological evidence like artifacts, fossils, and structures to understand our ancestors' lives. It's a fascinating journey into our collective past, uncovering stories of innovation, adaptation, and survival before history as we know it began.",11.3,39.94,13.0,13.0,13.06,14.38,5.56,7.75

Prehistory is the period of time before written records were kept by humans. It stretches back from the present day to around 3,300 BC, when the earliest known written language, Sumerian Cuneiform, was created in Mesopotamia. During prehistory, humans lived as hunter-gatherers, relying on nature for food and shelter. They developed tools and weapons from stones, bones, and wood. Art and religion also emerged during this time, as seen in cave paintings and early rituals. As humans learned to farm and domesticate animals, they settled in one place, marking the beginning of civilization. This transition from prehistory to history is a significant turning point in human development.",9.8,49.11,11.5,12.7,12.31,13.1,5.14,7.5

Prehistory is a term used to describe the time before written records. This period covers the lives of early humans, like Homo habilis and Homo erectus, who lived millions of years ago. They were hunters and gatherers, surviving on the food they could find or kill. Tools made from stones were their most important inventions. These tools helped them hunt animals and cut plants. Over time, humans learned to control fire, which helped them cook food and keep warm. This was a significant step towards modern life. After many thousands of years, humans started to create art, like cave paintings. This showed they had advanced thinking and creativity. Prehistory ended around 3500 BCE when humans started to write down their history. This is when we get our first written records, like the Epic of Gilgamesh from ancient Mesopotamia. So, prehistory is a vast period of human history, filled with important developments that shaped our world today.",6.9,67.45,9.1,10.0,7.94,11.01,4.32,5.888888888888889
