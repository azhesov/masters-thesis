Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It involves observing and understanding objects like stars, galaxies, and planets. Astronomy helps us learn about the universe's origin, evolution, and structure. It uses physics and mathematics to explain the cosmos, making it a fascinating blend of science and wonder.",8.7,52.05,9.9,10.9,10.32,11.75,4.69,5.3

    sentences = len(text.split('.')) - 1
    syllables = sum(len(word) - sum(word.count(vowel) for vowel in 'aeiou') for word in text.split())
    grade_level = 0.39 * (words / sentences) + 11.8 * (syllables / words) - 15.59
    return grade_level

text = ""Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects and phenomena. It uses mathematics, physics, and chemistry to explain the origin and evolution of objects and events in the universe.""

print(flesch_kincaid_grade(text))
