Let's start by thinking about how to explain 'computer security' in 50 words. We want to use simple, clear language that a fifth-grader could understand. Here's a possible explanation:

""Computer security is like locking your house. When you lock your house, you keep bad guys out. A computer has locks too, to stop hackers from getting in and causing trouble. These locks are like passwords and special codes. Computer security also means making sure your computer is healthy, like getting a vaccine for your computer.""

- Total words: 45
- Total sentences: 3
- Total syllables: 118 (using a syllable counter tool)
