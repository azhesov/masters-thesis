Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird. They ask the bird, ""Is this your egg?"" But the bird says, ""No, that is not my egg. Ask the owl. Maybe it is his egg."" Cat and Dog walk to the owl. They ask the owl, ""Is this your egg?""

Example 2:
The Sun’s light shines on Earth. The light makes our air, land, and water warm. But some things get
warmer than others.
Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

The goal is to teach children that it's important to keep their passwords secret and not share them with anyone. Use the example format of Cat and Dog to illustrate this:

Cat and Dog have a secret computer game. They keep their game on a computer. But one day, a sneaky mouse finds their computer. The mouse sees Cat and Dog's game. He wants to play it too. The mouse says, ""Let me play your game!"" But Cat and Dog say, ""No, this is our game. You can't play it."" The mouse asks, ""Why not? I want to play too."" Cat and Dog say, ""We keep our game safe with a secret password. Only we know it. You can't play without the password."" The mouse says, ""But I want to play! Tell me the password."" Cat and Dog say, ""No, we can't tell you. We promised to keep it a secret. If we tell you, other animals might find",1.6,97.4,1.5,6.4,4.25,2.28,2.42,2.1875

Computer security is like keeping a secret. Pretend Cat wants to show Dog a special picture on his computer. But Cat doesn't want Bird or any other animal to see it. So, Cat turns on the computer. Then Cat clicks on a special lock. This lock keeps other animals out. It's like a secret password. Now, only Cat and Dog can see the picture. If Bird tries to look, the computer says, ""No, this is not for you."" And the lock won't let Bird in. So, the secret is safe. But if Cat forgets the password, even Dog can't get in.

Pretend it is a sunny day. If you wore a black shirt, you would feel hot. But if you wore a white shirt, you wouldn’t feel as hot. The dark color absorbs more of the Sun’s energy. That makes the black shirt warm.
Light colors reflect more of the Sun’s energy. This makes the white shirt cooler to wear. See for yourself! You need a piece of black paper and a piece of white paper. You also need two thermometers and a lamp. Ask an adult to help you.
Fold the black paper so it makes a pocket. Do the same thing to the white paper. Next, put a thermometer into the black pocket. Do the same thing to the white pocket. Then put the pockets under the lamp. Turn the lamp on, and wait for 10 minutes. Then check the thermometers.
Which pocket got hotter — the black pocket or the white one? Do you know why?

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words. In this paragraph, include the following information: a computer is vulnerable to hackers, hackers try to get into computers without permission, passwords protect computers, but weak passwords can be easily broken, strong passwords are harder to guess, and using different passwords for each account helps keep computers safe.

A computer is like a house. It stores important things, like games, photos, and secrets. But a computer can be vulnerable, like a house with an open door. Hackers are like sneaky burglars. They try to get into computers without permission. They want to steal things or cause trouble. But computers have locks, like passwords. Passwords protect computers, just like locks protect houses. But some passwords are weak, like easy-to-guess locks. A hacker can break a weak password quickly. So, it's important to use strong passwords. Strong passwords are harder to guess, like a complex lock. Also, use a different password for each account. This is like having different",3.0,88.43,3.5,7.4,4.68,4.89,2.67,2.1875

Cat and Dog walk. They walk in their village. Then they see an egg. The egg is in the grass. The egg is alone in the grass. The egg is all alone. Cat and Dog walk to a bird.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words. In this paragraph, explain the importance of keeping a computer password secret.

Computers are like houses for our important things. These things could be our school work, games, or even pictures of our family. But sometimes, not-so-nice people want to get into these houses without permission. They might want to look at our stuff or even change it. This is why we need a secret code to keep our computers safe. This secret code is called a password. We should never tell anyone else our password, not even our best friend. If someone else knows our password, they could get into our computer and cause trouble. So, it's very important to keep our password a secret, just like we would hide our toys so our little brother can't play with them. This way, only we can get into our computer and keep our things safe.",1.9,96.59,2.7,6.9,4.68,3.67,2.58,2.1875

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (Early Elementary), limited to 200 words. Here's a hint: Use the word 'hackers' and describe how they try to 'break into' computers.

In the digital world, there are 'hackers'. They try to break into computers. They want to find secrets or cause trouble. They use tricks and tools to get into computers. These tricks are like keys that try to open locked doors. But computers have strong locks. These locks are called'security software'. They protect computers from hackers. Some computers have many locks. These computers are very safe. Other computers have fewer locks. They might not be as safe. It's important to have strong locks on your computer. This helps keep hackers out. It helps protect your secrets. It helps keep your computer safe.",1.5,97.8,2.3,6.9,4.27,3.55,2.48,2.1875

A computer is like a secret clubhouse. You want only your friends to come inside. So, you lock the door. But you need a special password to unlock it. This password is like a secret knock. It's different for every person. If someone tries to guess your password, they can't come in. That's how computer security works. It keeps bad guys out. They can't see your special things, like your games or your pictures. So, always use a strong password. Don't tell it to anyone. That way, only you can unlock your clubhouse.",1.5,97.7,1.9,6.4,4.2,2.91,2.47,2.1875
