""Nutrition is the process of providing and utilizing food for growth, maintenance, and repair of the body. It involves consuming a balanced diet that offers the right amount of nutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals. These nutrients play crucial roles in various bodily functions. For instance, proteins aid in building and repairing tissues, while carbohydrates serve as the primary energy source. Fats facilitate absorption of fat-soluble vitamins and provide insulation. Vitamins and minerals support immune function, bone health, and many other vital processes. Inadequate or imbalanced nutrition can lead to deficiencies and health issues, emphasizing the importance of a well-planned diet.""",9.1,50.94,11.7,12.2,11.46,13.62,5.12,5.888888888888889

**Nutrition** is the process by which our bodies use food to grow, develop, and function. It involves breaking down food into nutrients like proteins, carbohydrates, fats, vitamins, and minerals, which are then absorbed and used for various purposes. For instance, proteins help build and repair tissues, while carbohydrates provide energy for our cells. Fats are essential for brain function and absorbing certain vitamins. Vitamins and minerals support immune function, help prevent diseases, and maintain overall health. Balanced nutrition is crucial for a healthy life, as it ensures our bodies have the necessary resources to function optimally. A balanced diet includes a variety of foods from different groups, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats.
