Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

There is no specific scientific calculator prescribed for this subject. Any scientific, nonprogrammable calculator is suitable for your studies. Different scientific calculators have different functions and it is up to you to know your calculator. Most scientific calculators have algebraic logic; the operation in an expression can be entered in the calculator in the order in which the expression is read (left to right). The calculator automatically follows the conventional order of operations. 
You can setup your calculator to work either in natural display or linear display. Natural display causes fractions, irrational numbers, expressions, and certain functions to be displayed as you see them on paper. Linear display causes fractions and other expressions to be displayed in a line. 
When we come across an expression such as 7 + 3 ÷ 10 × 1, it makes a difference how we choose which operations to perform first.
Scientific calculators have been programmed to follow preset mathematical rules. If we press the buttons in a certain order, the calculator does the operations according to the rules that it has been programmed with.

Here's a paragraph about computer security at a higher level, which I can modify to meet the readability requirements:
""Computer security is a broad field of study that encompasses various techniques and protocols to safeguard computer systems and networks from malicious activities. These include firewalls, encryption methods, access control systems, and intrusion detection systems. Effective computer security requires a proactive approach, involving regular updates, patching vulnerabilities, and employee education. Moreover, organizations must also adhere to regulatory compliance and industry standards. As the threat landscape evolves, it is crucial to stay informed and adapt to new security measures to protect against emerging risks.""

A computer security program safeguards the system against viruses and malicious attacks. The program is like a shield that prevents unauthorized access to the computer. It works by analyzing the system's vulnerabilities and blocking any malicious code that tries to breach the system. Just as Daniel climbed hills for a broader view, a good security program provides a broader view of potential threats and takes preventive measures to safeguard the system. In the same way that Daniel's father's farm had a fence, a security program erects a digital fence to protect the system from harm. Its function is automatic and follows a set of predetermined rules. It can be set up to work in either a natural or linear display, depending on the user's preference. The security program follows preset rules to ensure the system's safety and prevent any potential threats. Just as Daniel could see the surrounding landscape from the sheep pasture, a security program provides a comprehensive view of the system's security status.

You can setup your calculator to work either in natural display or linear display. Natural display causes fractions, irrational numbers, expressions, and certain functions to be displayed as you see them on paper. Linear display causes fractions and other expressions to be displayed in a line. 
When we come across an expression such as 7 + 3 ÷ 10 × 1, it makes a difference how we choose which operations to perform first.
Scientific calculators have been programmed to follow preset mathematical rules. If we press the buttons in a certain order, the calculator does the operations according to the rules that it has been programmed with.

Using vocabulary and structure from examples, write a short paragraph about 'computer security' targeting the same readability level (High School), limited to 100 words. A computer system is an intricate network of interconnected hardware and software components that form the backbone of the digital world. To safeguard the system against unauthorized access, firewalls and intrusion detection systems are employed. Encryption is used to protect data by converting it into a coded format that can only be deciphered with the correct decryption key. Users must be cautious and keep their passwords confidential to prevent breaches and cyber-attacks. Vigilance is essential in this digital age.  (Note: I will make adjustments according to your feedback) 

Here is a paragraph about 'computer security' that is 100 words or less, with a readability level similar to the examples:

In the complex world of computer systems, security is paramount. Firewalls and intrusion detection systems shield the system from unauthorized access, while encryption transforms data into coded messages that only the right key can unlock. Users must be diligent in protecting their passwords and keeping them confidential, as a single breach can lead to devastating cyber-attacks.

Daniel was but eight years old, a boy of striking appearance, with black hair and eyes, and a swarthy complexion. He was of slender frame, and his large dark eyes, deep set beneath an overhanging brow, gave a singular appearance to the thin face of the delicate looking boy. He was a farmer's son, and lived in a plain, old-fashioned house, shaded by fine elms, and separated from the broad, quiet street by a fence. It was situated in a valley, at the bend of the Merrimac, on both sides of which rose high hills, which the boy climbed many a time for the more extended view they commanded. From a high sheep-pasture on his father's farm, through a wide opening in the hills, he could see on a clear day Brentney Mountain in Vermont, and in a different direction the snowy top of Mount Washington, far away to the northeast.

Computer security refers to the practices and techniques used to protect computers, networks, and data from unauthorized access or damage. It involves implementing various measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, and encryption to prevent cyber attacks and data breaches. Effective computer security also requires being cautious when using public Wi-Fi, avoiding suspicious emails, and keeping software and operating systems up to date. By taking these precautions, individuals can help safeguard their personal and sensitive information from falling into the wrong hands. This is essential in today's digital age. 

Here's an example of a rewritten paragraph, using vocabulary and structure from the original examples, to match the readability level and word limit.

The boy who spent hours in front of his computer was a prime target for cyber attacks. His slender frame and dark eyes made him almost invisible in the digital world. But his thin face and overhanging brow gave away his inexperience. He was a farmer's son, and his old-fashioned house was no match for the sophisticated malware that",10.9,51.68,12.8,13.7,12.06,11.95,5.45,15.25

The concept of computer security is as much a part of the digital world as the hills surrounding Daniel's home are part of the landscape. Just as the boy could climb the hills for a wider view, security experts must be aware of the broader landscape of potential threats to computer systems. A single misstep, much like a misstep on the hillside, can have serious consequences. By understanding the conventional order of operations and following established rules, individuals can navigate the digital terrain with greater confidence, avoiding the pitfalls that could compromise computer security.
