Here is a Python function to calculate the Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level:

```python
import math

def flesch_grade(text):
    words = text.split()
    sentences = len(text.split('. '))
    syllables = sum(sum(math.ceil(len(word) / 2) for word in sentence.split()) for sentence in text.split('. '))

    grade = 0.39 * (len(words) / sentences) + 11.8 * (syllables / len(words)) - 15.59
    return round(grade)
```
