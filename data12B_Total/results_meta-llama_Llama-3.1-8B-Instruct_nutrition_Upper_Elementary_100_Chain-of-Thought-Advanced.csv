Here is the final answer:
Nutrition is what we eat to keep our bodies healthy. Foods have different kinds of things like proteins, carbohydrates, and fats. Our bodies use these to work right. Fruits and vegetables are good for us because they have good things. Meat and fish are good too because they have protein. We need water to drink every day. We should eat a little bit of everything so our bodies can use what they need. Eating too much of one thing is not good. We should eat what makes us feel good. That is how we take care of our bodies. This is very important. We should learn more about it.  ```python
