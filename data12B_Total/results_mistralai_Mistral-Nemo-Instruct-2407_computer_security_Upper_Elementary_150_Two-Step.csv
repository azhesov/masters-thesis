Write a summary about 'computer security'. Limit the output to 150 words. Computer security, also known as information security, is the practice of protecting computer systems and networks from digital threats, damage, or unauthorized access. It encompasses various fields like cryptography, network security, and software security. Key aspects include confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Threats range from malicious software (malware) to cyberattacks by hackers or state-sponsored actors. To mitigate these risks, security measures such as firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, access controls, and regular updates and patches are employed. Additionally, user education and awareness play a crucial role in maintaining a robust security posture.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Upper Elementary and limit the output to 150 words:

The revised text for Upper Elementary level:

Computer security keeps our computers and important information safe from bad guys. It's like putting a lock on your school locker to stop others from opening it. We use special tools and rules to protect our computers and data. For example, we use secret codes to hide important information, like when we send a secret message to a friend. We also use something called a firewall to keep bad guys out of our computers. It's like a security guard at a big building, checking who can come in and who can't. We must always update our computer's rules and tell our friends not to share their secret passwords. We also learn to spot tricks called 'phishing' so we don't fall for them. Just like you wouldn't give your lunch money to a stranger, don't give your secret password to someone you don't trust. Lastly, we plan what to do",10.0,54.02,12.1,12.7,11.11,12.12,5.44,14.4
