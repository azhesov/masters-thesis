Prehistory, the period before recorded history, is a fascinating era that spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing systems approximately 5,000 years ago. This era is characterized by the absence of written records, making it challenging for historians to reconstruct human activities and cultures. However, archaeologists have uncovered a wealth of physical evidence, such as stone tools, pottery, and architectural remains, which provide valuable insights into the lives of our ancestors. Prehistory is often divided into several periods based on technological advancements, with the Stone Age being the most well-known. During this time, humans primarily relied on stone tools for hunting, gathering, and other activities. The discovery of agriculture around 10,000 years ago marked the transition from the Stone Age to the Bronze Age, and eventually to the Iron Age. Understanding prehistory is essential for tracing the origins of human civilization and gaining a deeper appreciation for our",13.1,35.07,15.1,15.2,15.54,15.03,6.33,12.333333333333334

Prehistory, the period before written records, is a fascinating era in human history. It spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago until the invention of writing, roughly 5,000 years ago. This vast stretch of time encompasses significant developments in human culture, technology, and society. Early humans, known as hunter-gatherers, migrated across continents, developing tools and languages. Around 10,000 years ago, the Neolithic Revolution brought agriculture, transforming human societies and leading to the development of civilizations. Despite the absence of written records, archaeologists and anthropologists reconstruct this period using artifacts, architecture, and genetic evidence. This interdisciplinary approach illuminates the complex stories of our ancient ancestors, offering insights into the origins of human culture and our shared past.",13.9,22.31,15.9,14.7,16.33,17.62,6.45,8.375

Prehistory refers to the time before written records began. This period covers the entire human experience from the first hominids to the invention of writing. It's divided into three main eras: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Each era is characterized by distinct tools, weapons, and social structures. The Stone Age, lasting from around 3.3 million years ago until 3300 BCE, is further divided into Lower, Middle, and Upper periods based on technological advancements. The Bronze Age, from 3300 BCE to 1200 BCE, marked a significant shift with the development of metallurgy. The Iron Age, beginning around 1200 BCE, saw another technological leap, with iron becoming the primary metal used in tools and weapons. These periods saw the rise and fall of civilizations, the spread of agriculture, and the evolution of human culture.
