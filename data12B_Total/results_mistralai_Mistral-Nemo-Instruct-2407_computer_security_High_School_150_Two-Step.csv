Computer security, or info security, protects computers, networks, and important data from online threats. It's about stopping, finding, and responding to cyber attacks. It also makes sure info stays secret, isn't changed, and is always available. To do this, you need strong security like firewalls, coded messages (encryption), regular software updates, strong passwords, and teaching people about security. You also need plans for if something goes wrong. In short, computer security is vital for safeguarding our digital lives and making sure technology works well and safely.",13.5,28.64,15.0,15.1,12.26,15.25,5.8,15.8
