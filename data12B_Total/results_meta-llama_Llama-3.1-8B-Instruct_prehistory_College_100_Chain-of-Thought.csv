Step 3: Write a paragraph of 100 words that follows your plan. Here is a possible response:
Prehistory spans the time period before written records began to be kept, roughly from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the development of writing systems in ancient civilizations around 5,000 years ago. During this time, humans evolved and migrated, developed complex social structures, and created tools and art. While prehistoric humans left behind few written records, their presence can be inferred from archaeological evidence such as stone tools, fossilized remains, and cave paintings. This period is significant because it laid the groundwork for the societies and cultures that followed. 
Step 4: Read over your paragraph to ensure clarity and coherence.
Step 5: Revise your paragraph if necessary. Consider adding more detail or using more precise language. Here is a possible revised paragraph:

The term prehistory refers to the period of time before written records existed, spanning from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing systems. This vast and largely undocumented era is often divided into several distinct phases, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. During prehistory, humans developed complex societies, harnessed new technologies, and shaped the natural environment through agriculture and other practices. Archaeological findings and oral traditions provide valuable insights into this mysterious period, allowing us to reconstruct and better understand the lives of our ancient ancestors.

Step 4: Read over what you have written and revise as needed.

Prehistory refers to the period of human existence prior to the advent of written records. It spans from the emergence of the first hominins around 6-8 million years ago to the development of writing systems, approximately 5,000 years ago. This era is characterized by the gradual development of complex societies, with evidence of tool use, language, and symbolic expression. The study of prehistory relies on archaeological and anthropological methods, including the analysis of material culture, fossil records, and comparative linguistics, to reconstruct the lives and cultures of ancient societies.

Prehistory is the period before written records. It extends from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of writing. This era is often divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic (Old Stone Age), the Mesolithic (Middle Stone Age), and the Neolithic (New Stone Age). Each period is characterized by distinct tool-making techniques and cultural developments. The Paleolithic is marked by the use of stone tools, such as knives and hand axes. The Mesolithic saw the introduction of microliths, small stone tools that were used for tasks like hunting and gathering. The Neolithic, meanwhile, is associated with the development of agriculture and the emergence of settled societies.

Prehistory, the era preceding written records, is a period of human development marked by the absence of documented evidence. It spans from the emergence of the first humans to the advent of writing, approximately 3.5 million to 5,000 years ago. During this time, human societies evolved through stages of nomadic hunter-gatherer, agricultural, and eventually complex societal formations. Archaeological findings and oral traditions offer glimpses into the lives of prehistoric people, providing a rich tapestry of information about their cultures, technologies, and ways of life.

Here is the revised version of the paragraph.

The term ""prehistory"" refers to the period of human existence that occurred before the advent of written records. This era, which spans from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing systems, is characterized by the absence of written documentation. As a result, the events of prehistory are reconstructed through archaeological evidence, such as artifacts, tools, and other material remains. By analyzing these artifacts, researchers can piece together a narrative of human history, including cultural and social developments, technological advancements, and migration patterns.

Here is the original paragraph:

prehistory means the time period before we could write. this is before written records. we dont have written records. we have artifacts. we use artifacts to learn about the past. 
The original paragraph is not suitable for a College-level reader because it uses simple vocabulary and sentence structure. It also lacks clarity and precision in explaining the concept of prehistory. The revised paragraph, on the other hand,",9.4,50.23,11.0,11.9,10.21,12.98,4.58,8.0

Step 1: Think about how to explain 'prehistory' to someone reading at the College level.
To explain prehistory to a College-level reader, I should provide a clear and concise definition, highlighting the time period and the sources of our knowledge. I can mention that prehistory refers to the time before written records existed, focusing on the archaeological evidence, oral traditions, and material culture that allow us to reconstruct the past. This approach will enable the reader to understand the limitations and strengths of prehistoric research, as well as the importance of interdisciplinary approaches.

Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
To maintain a sophisticated tone, I will use technical vocabulary such as 'archaeological evidence,''material culture,' and 'interdisciplinary approaches.' I will also employ complex sentence structures, including subordinate clauses and relative pronouns",11.8,38.52,13.9,13.7,12.85,15.08,5.38,8.285714285714286

Prehistory refers to the period of time before written records existed, during which humans developed from their earliest ancestors to the advent of writing. This era spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens to the invention of writing, which was first used by ancient civilizations in Mesopotamia around 3500 BCE. The prehistoric period can be divided into distinct stages, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras, each characterized by significant technological and social developments. These periods laid the groundwork for the complex societies and cultures that followed.

Note: I have followed the given instructions and written a 100-word paragraph that explains 'prehistory' at the College level, selecting appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure. The paragraph provides a clear overview of the prehistoric period, dividing it into distinct stages and highlighting significant technological and social developments.  Please let me know if you need any further changes.
