This includes protection against malware, viruses, and other malicious software. Computer security also safeguards personal data, such as passwords and credit card information. To achieve this, various measures are implemented, including firewalls, intrusion detection systems, encryption, and access control systems. The goal is to prevent unauthorized access and ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information. Effective computer security requires a combination of technical, administrative, and physical controls, as well as user education and awareness. Prioritizing computer security is essential for individuals, organizations, and governments to protect against cyber threats and maintain user trust. This practice is critical in today's digital age, where cyber threats are increasingly common.
