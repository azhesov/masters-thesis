- The cells in our bodies stop dividing and growing
- Our skin starts to wrinkle and lose elasticity
- Our bones become weaker
- Our heart and lungs do not work as well
- We gain weight and lose muscle
- Our senses, such as hearing and seeing, decline

Human aging is a complex process that affects all the cells, tissues, and organs in our body. As we grow older, our cells stop dividing and growing at the same rate as before. This slowdown is partly due to the shortening of our telomeres, the protective caps at the ends of our chromosomes. As a result, our skin begins to wrinkle and lose its elasticity, making it less able to heal and protect us. Our bones also become weaker, leading to an increased risk of fractures. Our heart and lungs do not function as efficiently as they used to, making it harder for us to perform physical activities. We may also gain weight and lose muscle",8.8,67.79,10.6,9.9,10.29,8.82,5.4,14.0

Here's a sample paragraph following these steps:

""Human aging is a natural process that happens over time. It's like when a car gets older, it starts to show signs of wear and tear. Our bodies do the same thing. As we get older, our cells stop working as well as they used to. This is because the DNA in our cells, which carries instructions for our bodies, gets damaged over time. It's like when a book gets old and its pages start to fall apart. This damage causes our bodies to change and slow down. We might not see or hear as well, our skin might wrinkle, and we might not have as much energy. Scientists are still learning about aging, but they know that it's a complex process that involves many different parts of our",5.0,83.25,6.9,8.0,7.15,7.76,4.1,6.125

Aging is a natural process that every human goes through over time. It's like a series of tiny, invisible changes that happen inside our cells, the smallest units that make up our body. You see, each cell contains a blueprint called DNA, which tells it how to function and grow. As we age, our cells' DNA can get damaged, causing them to stop working as well as they used to. This damage is what makes us look and feel older, with visible changes like wrinkles, gray hair, and slower movements. So, aging is a result of these gradual, invisible changes inside our cells that we can't see, but we can certainly feel and observe over time.",7.5,71.34,9.4,8.8,8.62,8.29,4.85,7.0

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 150 words that follows your plan. Use the 3-Step Writing Process.

**Planning:**

1. Start by defining 'aging' in a simple way.
2. Explain that aging is a natural process that happens to everyone.
3. Describe some physical changes that occur as we age, like wrinkles and gray hair.
4. Mention that aging also affects our bodies' functions, like making us tire more easily.
5. End by saying that aging is a part of life that should be embraced.

**Writing:**

Aging is a normal process that happens to all living things, including humans. It's like growing up, but instead of becoming taller and stronger, our bodies change in different ways. As we age, our skin gets wrinkles and our hair turns gray. Our bodies don't heal as quickly as they used to, and we might feel tired more often. This is because our cells and organs, which are like tiny building blocks that make up our body, start to work a little slower. But remember",6.4,74.29,7.6,8.0,6.79,7.88,4.08,5.222222222222222

Human aging is a natural process that happens to every living organism, including humans. It's like when a plant grows from a seed into a tall tree, then starts to show signs of age, like its leaves turning colors and falling off. In humans, aging starts from the moment we're born. Our bodies change as we grow, and these changes continue throughout our lives. Some changes are easy to see, like how we get taller as kids, then stop and our hair turns gray as adults. Other changes happen inside our bodies, like how our bones get stronger when we're young, then start to weaken with age. Scientists are still learning about why we age and how to slow it down, but they know that it's a normal part of life.",6.5,79.3,8.6,8.2,8.54,7.71,4.37,7.0
