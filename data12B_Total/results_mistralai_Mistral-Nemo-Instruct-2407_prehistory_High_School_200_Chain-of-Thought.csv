Prehistory, a term often used in history books, is a period that predates written records. This means there are no written accounts or historical documents to provide information about this time. Instead, we rely on archaeological evidence, such as artifacts and fossils, to understand what life was like. Imagine a time before books, when people communicated through speech and drawings. This was the world of prehistory. Archaeologists, scientists who study human history through physical remains, help us piece together this mysterious era. They examine tools, pottery, and even human and animal remains to learn about the societies that existed before writing was invented. The oldest known writing system, cuneiform, dates back to around 3200 BCE in ancient Sumer, marking the beginning of recorded history. Before this, we enter the realm of prehistory, where our understanding is shaped by the clues left behind in the ground.

Prehistory is the time period before written records began. It's like trying to imagine life on Earth before anyone could write down what was happening. People didn't have books or newspapers, so we can't read about their daily lives directly. However, archaeologists and scientists study the things they left behind, like tools, art, and buildings. For example, they've found ancient cave paintings in France and Spain that are over 30,000 years old. These paintings help us understand what people looked like and what animals they hunted during prehistory. We also know about ancient civilizations like the Indus Valley and ancient Egypt from the things they built, even though we don't have their personal stories written down. So while prehistory is a time without written history, it's not a time without history itself.",7.7,65.42,10.4,10.9,9.21,11.48,4.16,6.111111111111111

The time before written records is known as prehistory. This period in human history, spanning from the first emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing approximately 5,000 years ago, is often divided into three main stages: the Stone Age, the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. During the Stone Age, humans lived as nomadic hunter-gatherers, using tools made of stone, bone, and wood. This era was marked by significant developments such as the control of fire, the development of language, and the creation of cave art. Around 3300 BCE, the transition to the Bronze Age began, characterized by the use of",9.8,59.84,12.2,11.2,11.29,10.68,5.17,8.833333333333334

Step 3: Write a paragraph of 200 words that follows your plan. Remember to include a hook and an introduction.

Step 1:
Prehistory is a term used to describe the time period before the invention of writing, or before historical records began. This time span covers a vast period of time, from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of the alphabet.

Step 2:
To explain prehistory to a high school reader, I will use simple and familiar vocabulary, such as 'beginning', 'first', 'tools', and 'cave paintings'. I will also use clear and concise sentences to make the information accessible.

Step 3:
Long before the first written words, humans left their mark on the world in a time known as prehistory. This was a time of firsts: the first tools, the first art, and the first civilizations. Imagine the earliest humans, living in caves and using simple stone tools. They hunted for food, gathered plants, and created beautiful cave paintings to tell stories of their lives. This was a time",8.0,64.61,9.1,10.7,9.31,9.21,4.33,8.0

Step 4: Check your paragraph for understanding and vocabulary.

Here's a possible paragraph:

""Before people started writing down events, a vast amount of time passed. This period is often referred to as prehistory. It stretches from the first appearance of humans to the invention of writing. During this time, people lived in different ways. Some were nomads, moving from place to place in search of food. Others settled in one spot, growing crops and raising animals. They made tools from stone, bone, and wood. Later, they learned to work with metals like copper and bronze. Fire was their primary source of heat and light. Despite the lack of written records, we can learn about this time through the study of artifacts and structures left behind.""",5.5,76.52,8.5,9.0,7.41,9.43,3.96,5.888888888888889

**Plan:**

* Explain 'prehistory' as the period of time before written history was recorded.
* Use examples of prehistoric people and their cultures, like the Neanderthals and cave paintings.
* Discuss the importance of studying prehistory to understand human evolution and history.

**Paragraph:**

""Prehistory refers to the vast stretch of time before humans began recording their history through writing. This era spans from the emergence of the earliest humans until the invention of writing, roughly around 3000 BCE. During this period, humans coexisted with other early hominids like the Neanderthals, and developed various cultures, some of which are still visible today through cave paintings and artifacts. The study of prehistory is crucial as it provides valuable insights into human evolution, migration, and the development of early civilizations.",10.0,48.6,12.2,12.1,10.22,13.45,4.66,6.111111111111111
