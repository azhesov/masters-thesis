Limit the output to 150 words.,,"Generate a short paragraph about 'human aging' targeting readability level Graduate. Limit the output to 150 words. Human aging, a complex biological process, involves numerous changes in the body over time. Key alterations include cellular damage from oxidative stress, telomere shortening, and DNA mutations. Additionally, the immune system weakens, increasing susceptibility to diseases. Age-related changes also affect cognitive function, often leading to slower processing and memory decline. Furthermore, the body's ability to repair tissues and maintain homeostasis decreases, contributing to various age-related conditions such as osteoporosis, cardiovascular disease, and neurodegenerative disorders. Understanding the intricacies of human aging is crucial for developing targeted interventions and therapies to enhance healthspan and lifespan.",14.6,15.17,17.3,15.2,18.25,20.12,7.55,10.25
