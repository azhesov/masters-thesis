Prehistory, the period before written records, is a fascinating era in human history. It spans from the emergence of Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing, approximately 5,000 years ago. During this time, humans evolved physically and culturally, migrating across continents, developing complex languages, and creating intricate tools and art. The study of prehistory, known as archaeology, relies heavily on material culture and physical anthropology, as written accounts do not exist. Archaeologists piece together human history by examining artifacts, architecture, and human remains, offering insights into early human societies, their technologies, and cultural practices.",14.4,21.09,15.9,15.5,16.7,16.99,6.61,11.285714285714286

Prehistory, a term coined in the 19th century, refers to the time before written records. This era spans from the emergence of the earliest Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing systems, which occurred independently in various civilizations between 3400-3200 BCE. Prehistory is often divided into periods based on significant technological, cultural, or environmental changes, such as the Stone Age (Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic), Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Archaeologists and anthropologists study prehistory through the analysis of material culture, like tools, artifacts, and architectural remains, as well as through the examination of environmental data and human remains.
