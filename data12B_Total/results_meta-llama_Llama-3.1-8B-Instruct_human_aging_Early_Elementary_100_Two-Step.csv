As people get older, their bodies start to change. They might get slower, their hair might turn gray, and they might not be as strong as they used to be. This is because their cells get worn out and don't work as well as they used to. It's like when you leave a toy outside and it gets old and broken. Our bodies are like that too. But scientists are trying to figure out how to keep our bodies healthy and strong as we get older.

The final answer is:

Human aging is like a big process that happens to our bodies as we get older. It's like a big change that makes us less strong, less smart, and less healthy. Our bodies start to change at birth and keep changing until we die. We can slow down the changes by eating healthy food, exercising, and not getting too stressed. But some things like pollution and too much sun can make us age faster. Scientists are trying to figure out how to keep us healthy and strong as we get older.

We might also have trouble making friends or keeping up with our daily routines. As we get older, we might need more help with things we used to do by ourselves.

## Step 1: Identify the main ideas in the original text
The original text discusses human aging, which involves various biological, psychological, and social changes. These changes include cellular telomere shortening, brain structure and function changes, and social and emotional changes.

## Step 2: Simplify the language and concepts
