In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below. These rooms are also provided with a net-work of hot air pipes near the floor. The temperature is kept at about 165°, and so rapid is the drying process that in the short space of four hours the green log from the steam box is shaved, cut, dried, packed, and ready for shipment.

The following should be included in the paragraph: a comparison between two food items, a cause-and-effect explanation of how nutrition affects health, and an interesting fact.

Like a bean and a piece of straw, two foods are quite different in terms of their nutritional value. While a bean is a rich source of fiber and protein, a piece of straw, on the other hand, has almost no nutritional value. But just like how the bean was saved from being made into broth, our bodies can save themselves from many health problems if we eat nutritious foods. If we eat foods that are high in sugar and low in fiber, our bodies will suffer from many problems, such as obesity and diabetes. But if we eat foods that are rich in nutrients, like fruits and vegetables, we will have a strong immune system and be less likely to get sick. Interestingly, did you know that some foods, like apples, can even help to boost our immune system by containing antioxidants that help to fight off diseases?

The seeds of various fruits and vegetables have a protective coat that safeguards them until they reach the earth. When they sprout, they use this energy to grow into strong and healthy plants. However, if they were to be eaten before being planted, they would be vulnerable to diseases and pests that could harm their development. In the same way, a human body needs a balanced diet to stay healthy. The right foods provide the necessary nutrients to build strong muscles, support the immune system, and maintain a healthy mind. Just like the seeds that need time to grow, our bodies need time to absorb the nutrients from the food we eat. This process is called digestion, and it allows our bodies to extract the necessary energy and nutrients to function properly. Eating a variety of foods helps to ensure that our bodies receive all the necessary nutrients, keeping us strong and healthy. By taking care of our diet, we can promote overall well-being and live a long, healthy life.​

In a small village, there lived a young girl who wanted to stay healthy. She had learned about the importance of nutrition and how it can boost her energy levels. She started by eating a variety of fruits and vegetables. She would often eat an apple a day to keep the doctor away, and she believed that a bowl of oatmeal in the morning would give her the strength to tackle her day. She also made sure to drink plenty of water throughout the day. The girl’s mother had taught her that a balanced diet is key to maintaining good health. She had also learned that a lack of nutrition can lead to serious health problems. The girl took her mother’s advice seriously and made sure to eat nutritious food every day.

A young girl was on a diet, and she had a piece of fruit in her bag. As she was eating it, she thought, 'If I had not chosen this apple, I might have eaten a whole pizza, and my stomach would be unhappy now.' A friend of hers said, 'You are fortunate that you made that choice. It's good that you are taking care of your body.' 'Yes,' said the girl, 'because if I had eaten that pizza, I would have been lazy, and my energy would have been low. I want to feel happy and healthy, so I choose to eat fruits and vegetables.' 'You are making a good choice,' said the friend. 'They are good for your body, and you will feel full of energy.'

Food is a vital source of energy for our bodies. When we eat, our bodies digest the food we consume, breaking it down into smaller parts that can be used for energy. Different types of food have different nutrients that provide various benefits. Fruits and vegetables are rich in vitamins and minerals that help us stay healthy. Protein from meat, poultry, and fish helps our muscles grow strong. Carbohydrates from grains and bread provide energy for our bodies. If we eat a balanced diet that includes a variety of foods, our bodies will receive the nutrients they need to function properly. When we don't eat enough food or the right types of food, our bodies may suffer from malnutrition, leading to health problems. So, it's essential to make informed choices about the food we eat to ensure we get the nutrition our bodies need. Our bodies are like a machine that needs the right fuel to run efficiently.

When food is consumed, it travels through the digestive system to be broken down into energy and nutrients. These nutrients are absorbed into the bloodstream, which carries them to the cells of the body. The cells then use these nutrients to function properly. A balanced diet that includes a variety of foods provides all the necessary nutrients for the body. Foods such as fruits, vegetables, and whole grains are rich in vitamins and minerals that are essential for growth and development. They are also high in fiber, which helps to regulate bowel movements. On the other hand, foods high in sugar and fat can be detrimental to health if consumed excessively. A diet that is lacking in essential nutrients can lead to fatigue, weakness, and a weakened immune system.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Proper nutrition is the fuel for our bodies. Just as a car needs gasoline to run, our bodies need the right food to function properly. A diet rich in fruits, vegetables, and whole grains will give you the energy you need to get through your day. Without proper nutrition, our bodies can become sluggish, weak, and prone to illness. Just like the straw that escaped the fire, we too can avoid being ‘burnt to ashes’ by making healthy choices. We can choose to eat nutritious foods, stay hydrated, and exercise regularly. This will keep our bodies running smoothly and our minds sharp. By fueling our bodies with the right foods, we can stay healthy and strong, just like the bean that avoided being made into broth. By making these simple choices, we can live a happy and healthy life. Our bodies are like a machine that needs the right fuel to run properly. With proper nutrition, we can keep our bodies running like a well-oiled machine.

Nutrition is the study of the process by which our bodies get the energy and materials they need to function. In the same way that the poor old woman needed to cook her beans to get the nutrients out of them, our bodies need to digest the food we eat to get the nutrients they need. When we eat food, it is broken down into tiny particles by our digestive system. These particles are then absorbed into our bloodstream, where they are carried to all parts of the body. Just as the coal needed to be heated to escape the fire, our bodies need to be given the right nutrients at the right time to function properly. And just as the straw was left to dry in the dry rooms, our bodies need to be given time to process the nutrients they have absorbed. If we are given the right nutrients in the right amounts, our bodies will be healthy and strong, and we will be able to function at our best.

The nutritious food we eat provides the body with the energy and materials it needs to function and grow. A healthy diet is essential for maintaining a strong immune system, preventing diseases, and promoting overall well-being. A balanced meal should include a variety of foods from different groups, such as fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats. These foods provide the body with the necessary nutrients, including vitamins, minerals, and fiber, which are vital for optimal health. Fruits and vegetables are rich in antioxidants, which help protect the body from damage caused by free radicals. Whole grains, on the other hand, provide sustained energy and fiber, which can help lower cholesterol levels and promote digestive health. Eating a nutritious diet is crucial for maintaining a healthy body and mind. By making informed food choices, individuals can take control of their health and well-being.

Food and water are essential for our bodies to function properly. Nutrition plays a crucial role in giving us the energy we need to live. It is the process by which our bodies convert the food we eat into energy. Just like the straw, coal, and bean in the village, our bodies are made up of different components that need to be nourished to keep us healthy. Our brains need glucose to function properly, our muscles need protein to grow and repair, and our bodies need fiber to keep our digestive system running smoothly. If we don't get the right nutrients, our bodies can suffer the consequences. The old woman might have cooked the bean into a tasty meal, but if she didn't provide enough nutrients, the bean would have been left feeling weak and tired. Just like the bean, we need to make sure we get the right balance of nutrients to stay healthy and strong. A well-balanced diet is the key to good nutrition.",8.3,74.73,10.1,9.5,10.2,7.2,4.87,11.0
