Here's the output:
Prehistory is a term used to describe the period of time before written records existed. During this time, people lived in tribes and developed their own ways of life, including how they hunted, gathered, and made tools. The prehistoric period is divided into three main eras: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic era is characterized by the use of stone tools, while the Mesolithic era saw the development of more advanced tools and the emergence of early agriculture. The Neolithic era marked the beginning of settled farming and the rise of complex societies. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the lives of our ancestors and how they adapted to their environments.

The final answer is: 
Before written records existed, people lived and developed their cultures. This period is called prehistory. During this time, humans hunted animals and gathered plants to survive. People also developed tools from stone, wood, and bone. Over time, people learned to farm and grow their own food. They built shelters and settled in one place. Prehistory lasted until about 5,000 years ago, when people started writing their histories. We can learn about prehistory by studying the things that people left behind, such as tools, buildings, and art. By studying these artifacts, we can understand how people lived and what they believed. This helps us to know more about our ancestors. The study of prehistory is important because it gives us a glimpse into the lives of people who lived before written",6.6,68.26,9.0,9.4,7.21,10.54,4.03,5.666666666666667

Here's the prehistory paragraph:

Prehistory is the time before writing existed. It started after humans first appeared, about 6 million years ago. This time period continued until people developed writing, about 5,000 years ago. Many archaeologists study prehistory. They look for clues like tools, pottery, and buildings. These clues can tell us about the past. For example, the discovery of old tools shows how early humans made their living. The study of prehistory also helps us understand how people lived in different parts of the world. We can learn about their food, clothing, and homes. By studying prehistory, we can gain a better understanding of how humans evolved over time. This knowledge can also help us learn about the present and future. Overall, prehistory is an important subject that can teach us a lot about human history.

Prehistory is the time before written records existed. It's a period that spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. Since there are no written records, we rely on archaeological evidence to learn about prehistoric cultures. This includes fossils, tools, and other artifacts that provide clues about how people lived, worked, and interacted with their environments. By studying these remains, researchers can reconstruct the past and gain insights into human evolution, migration patterns, and technological advancements. Prehistory is often divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. Each period is characterized by distinct tools, social structures, and environmental adaptations. By exploring prehistory, we can better understand the complexities of human history and the ways in which our ancestors shaped the world we live in today. This knowledge helps us appreciate the depth and richness of human experience.

The first humans appeared on Earth during the Paleolithic Era, which dates back to around 2.5 million years ago. This era is also known as the Old Stone Age. During this time, early humans were hunter-gatherers, meaning they roamed the land in search of food and shelter. They likely lived in small groups and had a very primitive way of life. They used simple tools made of stone and wood, such as clubs, knives, and spears, to hunt for food and protect themselves from predators. The early humans also had a basic understanding of fire, which they used for warmth, cooking, and light. They likely had a short lifespan, with an average life expectancy of around 30 years. Despite their primitive way of life, early humans were able to adapt to their environment and survive in some of the harshest conditions on Earth.

Prehistory is the study of the time before written records. It is a field of science that looks at the lives of our ancestors from the earliest humans to the time just before the development of writing. This time period is very long and includes many different cultures and societies. Archaeologists use tools and methods to learn about the past and understand the people who lived before us. By studying artifacts, tools, and other remains, they can piece together a picture of how people lived and what their lives were like. The study of prehistory helps us understand the history of human societies and how they developed over time.

Prehistory is the period before written records began. It starts at the beginning of human existence and continues until writing first emerged in various civilizations.

The era of prehistory is further divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic periods. During these periods, humans learned to hunt, gather, and eventually, develop agriculture. This was a time of great change, with the development of new tools, the growth of settlements, and the rise of complex societies.

Prehistory is the time period before written records were kept. This era is often divided into three stages: Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic. The Paleolithic period, also known as the Stone Age, lasted from 2.6 million years ago until about 10,000 years ago. During this time, humans developed basic tools from stones and used them for hunting and gathering food. In the Mesolithic period, which followed the Paleolithic, humans began to use more complex tools and develop early forms of art. The Neolithic period, also known as the New Stone Age, began around 10,000 years ago and is marked by the development of agriculture and the domestication of animals. This period saw the rise of settled communities and the emergence of early civilizations. Overall, prehistory is a time of significant human development and transformation. The era laid the foundation for the complex societies that exist today. It is a fascinating topic that continues to be",7.9,59.5,9.4,11.1,9.34,11.18,4.34,5.3
