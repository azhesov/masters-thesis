Write a summary about 'prehistory'. Limit the output to 100 words. Prehistory refers to the period before written records began. It spans from the origin of the species Homo sapiens around 300,000 years ago to the invention of writing systems, roughly 3,400 BCE. This era is divided into three key stages: the Stone Age (Paleolithic, Mesolithic, Neolithic), the Bronze Age, and the Iron Age. Each stage is characterized by significant technological advancements, cultural shifts, and the emergence of civilizations. Archaeological evidence provides insights into prehistory, revealing human evolution, migration patterns, and the development of complex societies.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Early Elementary and limit the output to 100 words:

Prehistory is divided into three main eras: the Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age, based on the primary materials used for tools and weapons. Each era saw advancements in technology, culture, and society. The Stone Age, lasting from 3.3 million years ago to 3300 BCE, is further divided into the Lower, Middle, and Upper Paleolithic periods. During the Stone Age, humans learned to use tools made from stone, bone, and wood. They also created cave art and built shelters. The Bronze Age, from 3300 to 1200 BCE, brought significant changes. People learned to make tools and weapons from bronze, which is stronger than stone. They also invented new ways to farm and build cities. The Iron Age, from 1200 BCE to 0, saw even more changes. Iron tools and weapons were stronger than bronze, helping people farm more land and build bigger cities. Prehistory ended when people started writing down their history. This happened around 3500 BCE in places like Mesopotamia and Egypt.",5.9,75.4,8.6,9.9,8.6,9.85,3.95,8.571428571428571

Despite the lack of written records, archaeologists use artifacts and other physical evidence to study this period.

Prehistory is the time before writing. It starts with our first human ancestors, 7 million years ago. It ends when people start writing, around 3000 BCE. There are three main parts: Stone Age, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. Each part has different tools. Key things that happened include: humans moving around the world, farming starting, and people living together in cities. Even without writing, scientists can learn about this time by looking at old things people made and left behind.",8.2,64.2,11.0,11.7,10.56,11.77,4.65,13.4
