Prehistory is the time period before written records existed. This means that we don't have written documents or newspapers to tell us about the people and events of the past. Instead, we have to rely on other clues like fossils, artifacts, and archaeological sites to learn about the lives of our ancestors. These clues can be found all around us, from the tools made by early humans to the ruins of ancient civilizations. By studying these clues, we can piece together a picture of what life was like for people in the past.

Many of the events that happened during prehistory, like how people hunted and gathered food, how they made tools, and how they lived in groups, are still unknown to us. We know some things about prehistory from fossils and other clues that scientists find. For example, we can learn about ancient animals from fossils that have been found in the ground. We can also learn about ancient human tools from objects that have been discovered in caves and other places.
Scientists use clues like these to make educated guesses about the lives of people and animals who lived a long time ago. These guesses are helpful, but they are not always certain. We will never know for sure how people lived in prehistory, but we can use our imagination and what we have learned from clues to picture what",7.3,71.85,9.0,9.7,8.41,9.16,4.03,7.142857142857142

Prehistory is the period of time before written records were kept. It begins at the start of human history, around 2.5 million years ago, and ends with the invention of writing, around 5,000 years ago. During this time, early humans developed tools, learned to control fire, and hunted for food. They also started to migrate to different parts of the world. As people moved, they encountered new environments and new animals to hunt. They adapted to these changes and developed new ways of surviving. 
The earliest humans lived in small groups and were nomadic, which means they did not stay in one place for long. They followed the animals they hunted and the seasons to find food. Over time, these groups grew into tribes, and the tribes developed their own cultures and ways of living. As prehistory came to an end, these early societies were beginning to take shape. They were developing systems of government, laws, and trade. They were also starting to create art",5.8,75.61,8.0,9.8,7.83,9.38,3.98,5.555555555555555

Before the dawn of recorded history, human beings lived on Earth. This is known as the prehistoric era. During this time, people had not yet developed writing, so they left behind no written records of their lives. Instead, archaeologists rely on physical evidence like fossils, tools, and artifacts to reconstruct what life was like back then. Prehistory can be divided into three main periods: the Paleolithic Era, the Mesolithic Era, and the Neolithic Era. Each of these eras saw significant developments in technology, social organization, and the environment. In the Paleolithic Era, early humans hunted and gathered for food. They made simple tools, such as stone knives and clubs, and lived in small groups. As the climate changed and populations grew, humans developed more complex tools and societies during the Mesolithic Era. Eventually, with the advent of agriculture, humans entered the Neolithic Era and began to settle in one place, cultivating crops and domesticating animals.

I have finished the five steps. Here is my paragraph:

Prehistory is the study of human history before written records existed. This time period spans from the earliest humans, over two million years ago, to the invention of writing, which occurred around 5,000 years ago. During prehistory, people lived in different environments and developed various cultures. They created tools, hunted for food, and built shelters. Archaeologists, who are scientists that study the past, use evidence from artifacts, such as tools and pottery, to learn about prehistoric people. By studying these artifacts, archaeologists can understand how people lived, what they believed in, and how they interacted with their environment. The study of prehistory helps us learn about our ancient ancestors and how they shaped the world we live in today.

Prehistory is a time period before humans started writing things down. We know about this time from fossils, artifacts, and the study of the Earth's rocks. People lived in different parts of the world during prehistory, and their ways of life varied. Some of them were hunters and gatherers, while others farmed the land. 
The first humans likely originated in Africa and spread to other parts of the world. As humans traveled and settled in new areas, they brought their tools, customs, and languages with them. They built shelters, made clothing, and hunted for food. The earliest humans probably lived in small groups and had a limited understanding of the world around them. Over time, they developed more complex societies and started to make tools from stone, bone, and wood. The study of prehistory helps us understand how humans evolved and how different cultures developed over time. By examining the past, we can learn about the people who came before us and how they adapted to their environments.",7.8,65.12,9.5,10.3,8.98,10.32,4.33,6.5

""Prehistory"" is the time before recorded history. This means that it is the period before people started writing things down. People have always lived on Earth, but until about 5,000 years ago, there was no written record of what they did, where they lived, or how they lived. This was a time of hunting and gathering, when people traveled from place to place in search of food. People also started to settle in one place and build homes. This is when early societies started to develop, and people began to trade with each other. They also developed tools and learned how to work with metals like copper and bronze. The people of prehistory left behind artifacts, such as pottery, tools, and jewelry, that we can study today to learn about their lives. By studying these artifacts, we can get a glimpse of what life was like before written records existed. This helps us understand how human societies developed and changed over time.

Here's the paragraph:
Imagine living in a world without cars, computers, or even written records. This was the world of our ancestors, who lived before history was recorded. This period, called the prehistoric era, began with the earliest humans and lasted until the invention of writing, around 5,000 years ago. During this time, people relied on oral traditions and passed down stories through generations by word of mouth. Early humans developed tools, hunted for food, and protected themselves from predators. As time passed, humans began to settle in one place and develop more complex societies. They created art, built homes, and developed tools made from stone, bone, and wood.

Prehistory is the time before written records existed. It stretches from the earliest humans to the beginning of history, which is usually defined as the start of writing. This period is often divided into three main parts: the Paleolithic Era, the Mesolithic Era, and the Neolithic Era. During the Paleolithic Era, early humans, called hunter-gatherers, roamed the Earth, living off the land and following herds of animals. They used tools made from stones, wood, and bone to hunt, gather, and protect themselves. As time passed, people learned to farm the land and domesticate animals, leading to the Neolithic Era, where farming became a main source of food. The Mesolithic Era came in between, where people began to settle in one place and develop more complex societies. These eras were not as clearly defined as they seem",8.3,63.8,10.2,11.0,9.92,10.5,4.57,8.0

The prehistoric era was a long time ago, before writing existed. It began about 3.5 million years ago and lasted until around 4,000 BCE. During this time, humans evolved from early ancestors like Homo habilis and Homo erectus. These early humans were hunter-gatherers, which means they hunted animals for food and gathered plants, fruits, and nuts to eat. They lived in small groups, often in caves or under rocks, and made simple tools from stone, wood, and bone. 

As humans evolved, they developed more complex tools and learned to farm, which helped them settle in one place and create larger communities. The invention of the wheel around 4,000 BCE marked the beginning of the Bronze Age, which brought significant changes in technology and society.
