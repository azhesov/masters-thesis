Write a summary about 'astronomy'. Limit the output to 200 words. Astronomy is the scientific study of celestial objects, spaces, and phenomena that originate outside Earth's atmosphere. It encompasses the origin, evolution, properties, and interactions of celestial bodies, like stars, planets, galaxies, and black holes. Astronomers use observations, mathematics, physics, and chemistry to explain the universe's structure and behavior. They study the universe's origin and evolution, from the Big Bang to the present day. Key tools include telescopes, satellites, and space probes, with discoveries often made through observing electromagnetic radiation, such as light, radio waves, and X-rays. Astronomy plays a fundamental role in our understanding of the cosmos, pushing the boundaries of knowledge and inspiring generations.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Upper Elementary and limit the output to 200 words:

Revised text:

Astronomy is the study of objects and events in space, like stars, planets, and galaxies. It uses science like physics, math, and chemistry to understand how these things began and changed over time. Astronomy has many parts, such as studying the Sun (solar astronomy) and planets (planetary science). We also study things like black holes and planets around other stars (exoplanets). To see these, we use big telescopes on Earth and in space. These telescopes see different types of light, like the light we can see and special kinds we can't see with our eyes. Recent discoveries include finding waves caused by black holes (gravitational waves), water on the Moon, and the first picture of a black hole.

Astronomy is like a big adventure to learn about the universe. It's a science that uses math, physics, and chemistry to understand things like stars, planets, and galaxies. Astronomy tries to find out how these objects were born and how they change over time. It also looks at big structures in space and how they move. Some main topics in astronomy are studying the whole universe (cosmology), how stars and other objects work (astrophysics), and learning about planets (planetary science). Astronomers use special tools like telescopes on Earth and in space to gather information. They study this data to make guesses (hypotheses) and create ideas (theories) about the universe.
