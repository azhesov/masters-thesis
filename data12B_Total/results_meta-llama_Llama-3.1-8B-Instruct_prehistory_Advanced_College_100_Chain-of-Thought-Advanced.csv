Here's the text: 
Prehistory is the time period before written records existed. This was a long time ago, before people wrote books, kept journals, or recorded events. People lived in small groups, often in the same place year after year. They hunted and gathered food, and made tools from stone, bone, and wood. As time passed, people began to move to new places, and eventually developed more complex societies.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level of the given text is approximately 7.5. Let's increase it to approximately 15.

Here's the rewritten text:
Prehistory, which spans thousands of years, refers to the time period preceding the advent of written records. This epoch was marked by the absence of written documentation, such as books, journals, and historical accounts. During this time, human societies existed in a state of relative simplicity, often consisting of small, localized groups that engaged in hunting and gathering activities.

Here's a draft of the paragraph:
The term 'prehistory' refers to the period of time before written records existed. This period spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing, which varies by culture and region. In many cultures, this period began around 10,000 years ago and ended with the development of written languages. Archaeologists study artifacts and other evidence to reconstruct the lives and cultures of people from prehistoric times.

The Flesch-Kincaid Grade Level for the paragraph is approximately 10.65, which is lower than the target value of 15. To improve the vocabulary and sentence structure, consider the following changes:

* Use more complex vocabulary, such as 'ancient civilizations' instead of 'people from prehistoric times'.
* Use more sophisticated sentence structures, such as compound or compound-complex sentences.
* Add more descriptive details, such as 'the earliest human societies' or 'the development of complex societies'.

Prehistory is the period of time before written records began. It spans from the emergence of the first humans to the invention of writing. During this time, humans developed complex societies, created art and tools, and migrated across the globe. Archaeologists study prehistory by analyzing artifacts and environmental evidence. They can reconstruct the lives of ancient people and understand their cultures. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the origins of modern societies and the evolution of human civilization. The study of prehistory helps us understand how humans adapted to their environments and developed new technologies. This knowledge can also inform our understanding of contemporary issues, such as sustainability and cultural diversity.

Prehistory is the period before written records. This era spans from the emergence of the first humans to the development of writing systems. Archaeologists study the material remains of past cultures to learn about their lives. They look at artifacts, such as tools and pottery, to understand the technology and social structures of ancient societies. By analyzing the data, researchers can reconstruct the history of prehistoric humans and understand their daily lives, traditions, and interactions with their environments. The study of prehistory helps us appreciate the complexity and diversity of human societies that existed before the advent of writing. This knowledge allows us to better comprehend our shared human heritage and the evolution of modern societies. By examining the artifacts and the environments in which they were created, we can gain insights into the lives of prehistoric humans and the ways in which they adapted to their surroundings. The study of prehistory also highlights the significance of cultural exchange and the impact of environmental factors on human societies.

Prehistory is the period of time before written records began. This time period spans from the emergence of the first humans, about 6 million years ago, to the invention of writing, around 5,000 years ago. During prehistory, humans developed from early apes to complex societies. People created tools, hunted, gathered, and eventually formed settled communities. Prehistory is often divided into several periods, including the Paleolithic, Mesolithic, and Neolithic eras. Each of these periods marked significant changes in human society and technology. Despite the lack of written records, archaeologists have pieced together the lives of our ancestors using artifacts and other clues. By studying prehistory, we can learn about the origins of human culture, language, and behavior.

During this time, people developed tools, settled in permanent locations, and began to domesticate plants and animals. The study of prehistory helps us understand how humans evolved and adapted to their environments, and how societies developed over time.
