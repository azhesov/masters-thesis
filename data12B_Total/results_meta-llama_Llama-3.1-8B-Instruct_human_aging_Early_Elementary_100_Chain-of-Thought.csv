As you get older, your body starts to change. It's like your car needs new tires to run smoothly. When you're little, you can run fast and play a lot. But as you grow up, your body needs rest more often. Your skin gets wrinkles, and your hair turns gray or white. This is because your body is getting older, like a car with worn-out tires. It's not bad; it's just a normal part of life. Everyone's body changes as they grow up, and that's what makes us unique.

Human aging is when people get older and grow. When we are born, we are very small and need our parents to take care of us. As we grow up, our bodies get stronger and we can do more things. We learn to walk, run, and talk. When we are young, our skin is smooth and soft, but as we get older, it gets wrinkles and gets a little softer. My grandma is older and her hair is gray. She is still happy and loves to play with me.

I have finished the five steps. Here is my paragraph:

Our bodies change as we grow older. When we are young, our skin is smooth and tight. As we age, our skin gets wrinkles. Our hair turns gray or white. Our bodies get a little slower, but our hearts keep beating. Our brains remember lots of things. We learn and grow, but our bodies don't grow as much. We become adults, then seniors. Our bodies do many amazing things, but they also get old and tired.

Here is my revised paragraph after reviewing and revising:

But even though our bodies change, we still feel happy and excited about life. We learn new things, make new friends, and have new experiences. Our brains get smarter and smarter, and we can remember more things. We grow up to be strong, wise, and kind people.""

To explain human aging to someone at the Early Elementary level, we should focus on simple and concrete concepts that they can relate to and understand. We might explain that growing older is a natural process that happens to everyone, and it involves changes that we can observe in ourselves and others.

### Step 2: Select appropriate vocabulary and sentence structure.
For Early Elementary readers, we should use short sentences and simple vocabulary that they are familiar with. We can also use examples and comparisons to make the explanation more relatable and engaging.

Your paragraph should include the following key ideas:
- Humans age as they get older
- This is natural
- It affects the way our bodies look and feel
- Our bodies get weaker and slower
- Our brains keep getting smarter

Here is my paragraph:

As we get older, our bodies change. This is called growing older. It's a natural thing. When we're little, our bodies are strong and fast. But as we get older, our bodies start to get weaker. Our joints creak, and we might get slower. But our brains keep getting smarter! We can learn new things and remember more. Our bodies might look different too. We might get gray hair or wrinkles. But that's okay! Growing older is a normal part of life. We should be proud of how far we've come.
