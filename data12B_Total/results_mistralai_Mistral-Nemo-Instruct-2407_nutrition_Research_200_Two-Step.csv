Write a summary about 'nutrition'. Limit the output to 200 words. NUTRITION is the process of providing or obtaining the food necessary for health and growth. It involves the ingestion, digestion, absorption, and metabolism of nutrients. Adequate nutrition is essential for maintaining overall health, supporting immune function, and preventing chronic diseases like diabetes and heart disease. A balanced diet, rich in fruits, vegetables, whole grains, lean proteins, and healthy fats, is recommended. Regular exercise and adequate hydration are also crucial components of good nutrition. Poor nutrition, such as eating too much sugar and unhealthy fats, can lead to obesity, high blood pressure, and other health issues. Therefore, understanding and practicing good nutrition habits is vital for long-term health and well-being.","Rewrite the following text to match the readability level of Research and limit the output to 200 words:

Research-level summary:
Nutrition, the process of food intake, absorption, metabolism, and excretion, is vital for organismal health and growth. It necessitates adequate intake of macronutrients (proteins, fats, carbohydrates) and micronutrients (vitamins, minerals) for optimal bodily functioning. Inadequate or imbalanced nutrition can result in deficiencies, obesity, and chronic diseases such as diabetes and cardiovascular disease. Recent research underscores nutrition's role in mental health, gut microbiota composition, and chronic disease prevention. Further study is required to elucidate these complex interactions and optimize nutritional recommendations.",14.2,21.5,16.3,16.4,15.55,17.69,6.02,10.857142857142858
