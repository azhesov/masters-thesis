Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

Human aging is a universal, natural process that has been extensively studied by scientists and scholars. It is a complex, multifaceted phenomenon that has been influenced by various factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental conditions. Human aging encompasses the biological, psychological, and social aspects of aging, including senescence, cognitive decline, and mortality. Theories of aging are diverse, ranging from the free radical theory to the telomere shortening theory, each attempting to explain the underlying mechanisms and processes that contribute to the aging process. Further research is needed to fully understand the intricacies of human aging.  Theories of aging have been widely debated and discussed in various academic and professional contexts.",15.0,35.71,18.0,16.9,17.54,14.05,7.19,18.0

Human aging, a process governed by biological, psychological, and social factors, is the culmination of various cellular, physiological, and neurological changes that occur throughout a person's life. Theories of aging have been extensively studied by gerontologists, who have proposed various explanations for the underlying mechanisms, including the telomere shortening hypothesis, the free radical theory, and the epigenetic theory. Research has shown that aging is a multifaceted process, influenced by genetic, environmental, and lifestyle factors, leading to a decline in physical and cognitive abilities, and ultimately, the transition from a state of vitality to one of vulnerability and mortality. Aging is a universal experience.

Human aging is the study of the physiological, psychological, and social processes associated with the deterioration of human health and the progression of old age. The discipline, often referred to as gerontology, seeks to understand the biological mechanisms underlying the aging process, as well as the cultural and environmental factors that influence an individual's quality of life as they age. By examining the complex interplay between physical, cognitive, and emotional changes, researchers aim to identify potential interventions and strategies for promoting healthy aging and mitigating the negative consequences of aging. This multidisciplinary approach informs our understanding of human aging.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities.

Human aging is the process by which human bodies deteriorate over time. While the rate of aging varies between individuals, it is generally a universal phenomenon governed by physical and biological laws. Scientific studies of human aging have led to the identification of various factors contributing to its acceleration, including environmental influences, genetic predispositions, and lifestyle choices. Philosophers and scholars have also explored the existential implications of human aging, examining its relationship to human identity, mortality, and the meaning of life. The study of human aging is a multidisciplinary field that draws upon insights from biology, psychology, and philosophy.

Human aging is a multifaceted process influenced by genetics, lifestyle, and environmental factors. Telomeres, protective caps on chromosomes, shorten as we age, contributing to cellular senescence. Mitochondrial dysfunction and epigenetic changes also play significant roles. Theories, such as the free radical theory, suggest that oxidative stress accelerates aging. While some research focuses on senolytic therapies, others explore caloric restriction and exercise interventions. Theories of human aging are not mutually exclusive, and the complex interplay between genetic and environmental factors necessitates an interdisciplinary approach. Further research is needed to understand and mitigate the aging process. Various models have been proposed to explain human aging.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​.​",13.8,38.76,17.5,16.0,16.52,14.51,6.8,18.0

The study of human aging is a multifaceted field that encompasses the biological, psychological, and sociological aspects of the aging process. Aging is the universal human experience, yet the causes and consequences of aging are not fully understood. Theories of aging range from the cellular and molecular level to the population and demographic level, and involve the interplay of genetics, lifestyle, and environment. Human aging is a complex and dynamic process that has been shaped by evolution, culture, and history, and continues to be a subject of scientific investigation and philosophical inquiry. It is a rich and fascinating field of study.  Theories of aging have been developed and tested by researchers from various disciplines.

Human aging is a multifaceted phenomenon that has fascinated scholars across various disciplines. It is the study of the biological, psychological, and social changes that occur throughout an individual's life. Human aging is often divided into three distinct phases: physical aging, which refers to the decline in physical capabilities and the onset of diseases; psychological aging, which encompasses the changes in cognitive function, personality, and emotional well-being; and social aging, which involves the changes in social roles, relationships, and status. Understanding human aging is crucial for developing effective strategies to promote healthy aging and improve the quality of life for older adults. It is a complex and multifaceted field of study.  It has attracted the attention of scientists, philosophers, and social scientists alike.   Human aging is often seen as a universal phenomenon that transcends cultural and geographical boundaries. It is influenced by a variety of factors, including genetics, lifestyle, and environmental conditions.
