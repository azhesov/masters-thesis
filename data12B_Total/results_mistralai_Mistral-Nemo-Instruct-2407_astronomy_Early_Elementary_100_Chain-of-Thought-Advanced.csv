Astronomy is the study of stars, planets, and other objects in space. People have looked at the sky since ancient times. They saw patterns like pictures called constellations. Today, scientists use powerful telescopes to learn more about stars. Stars are like suns in other galaxies. They are big balls of hot gas. Some are bigger than our sun. Others are smaller.
