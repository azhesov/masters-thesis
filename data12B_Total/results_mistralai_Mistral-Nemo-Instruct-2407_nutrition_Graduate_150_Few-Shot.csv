Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

It was believed by the principal men of Virginia that Talbot's sympathies were with the revolted colonies; but the influence of his mother, to whom he had been accustomed to defer, had hitherto proved sufficient to prevent him from openly declaring himself. His visit to England, and the delightful reception he had met with there, had weakened somewhat the ties which bound him to his native country, and he found himself in a state of indecision as humiliating as it was painful. Lord Dunmore and Colonel Wilton had each made great efforts to enlist his support, on account of his wealth and position and high personal qualities. It was hinted by one that the ancient barony of the Talbots would be revived by the king; and the gratitude of a free and grateful country, with the consciousness of having materially aided in acquiring that independence which should be the birthright of every Englishman, was eloquently portrayed by the other. When to the last plea was added the personal preference of Katharine Wilton, the balance was overcome, and the hopes of the mother were doomed to disappointment.

The term 'nutrition' was first used in English in 1799 by Jean Valade, a French biologist, in his book 'Dissertations sur la nutrition'. The study of nutrition, or dietetics, is the interpretation of food and drink in relation to health.

Nutrition (from the Latin nutrire, ""to nourish""), is the science of food and drink and their effects on the body. It involves understanding how nutrients in our diet support growth, repair, and maintenance of body structures and functions. The study of nutrition has evolved significantly since its inception, with the development of new technologies and scientific methods. Today, nutritionists and dietitians use this knowledge to advise individuals and communities on healthy eating habits, helping to prevent and manage diseases like obesity, diabetes, and heart disease. The term nutrition was first used in English in the late 18th century, but its modern usage in the scientific context began in the mid-19th century with the work of scientists like Justus von Liebig and Jean Baptiste Dumas. Despite its scientific basis, the field of nutrition also involves ethical and social considerations, such as food security and sustainability, highlighting its interdisciplinary nature.",15.7,33.68,18.7,16.5,17.39,13.88,7.28,18.0

Nutrition, from the Latin 'nutrire', meaning 'to nourish', is the study of food and drink and their effects on the body. It involves understanding the nutrients in food, how the body uses them, and how diet influences health. This scientific field is explored by various professionals, such as dietitians and nutritionists, who advise on healthy eating habits. However, it's important to note that nutrition is not just about science; cultural beliefs and personal preferences also play a significant role in what people choose to consume. Thus, theories in nutrition may encompass both scientific findings and individual choices, some of which might not be objectively measurable.",14.2,42.95,18.0,16.5,17.1,13.23,7.07,18.0

Nutrition (from the Latin nutrire, ""to nurture""), is the study of how organisms consume and use food for growth, maintenance, and repair. It encompasses the discovery of essential nutrients, the body's metabolism, and the dietary needs of different life stages and species. This interdisciplinary field is explored by scientists, including nutritionists, dietitians, and biochemists, as well as healthcare professionals and policymakers. The study of nutrition also extends to public health, food science, and agriculture, making it a vital aspect of global health and sustainability.",15.6,33.99,18.6,16.6,17.65,13.64,7.22,18.0

Cosmology (from the Greek kosmos, ""world"" and logia, ""study of""), is the study of the origin, evolution, and eventual fate of the universe. Physical cosmology is the scholarly and scientific study of the origin, evolution, large-scale structures and dynamics, and ultimate fate of the universe, as well as the scientific laws that govern these realities.
The term cosmology was first used in English in 1656 in Thomas Blount's Glossographia, and in 1731 taken up in Latin by German philosopher Christian Wolff, in Cosmologia Generalis.
Religious or mythological cosmology is a body of beliefs based on mythological, religious, and esoteric literature and traditions of creation and eschatology.
Physical cosmology is studied by scientists, such as astronomers and physicists, as well as philosophers, such as metaphysicians, philosophers of physics, and philosophers of space and time. Because of this shared scope with philosophy, theories in physical cosmology may include both scientific and non-scientific propositions, and may depend upon assumptions that can not be tested.

The term ""nutrition"" was first coined in 1615 in English by Thomas Moffett, a physician and poet, in his work ""Health's Improvement"". Nutrition, from the Latin nutrire, ""to nourish"", is the study of the processes by which an organism takes in and utilizes food substances to support growth, development, and health. It encompasses the study of nutrients, their sources, and how they are metabolized in the body. Nutritional science is a multidisciplinary field, drawing from biology, chemistry, medicine, and public health. It involves understanding how different foods and diets impact health, both positively and negatively. Scientists, dietitians, and other health professionals contribute to the field, advancing our knowledge of nutrition and its role in preventing and managing diseases.",13.9,43.77,17.8,16.2,17.03,13.47,6.98,18.0
