Here is the final answer.


Computer security, also known as infosec, is the practice of protecting computer systems, networks, and data from unauthorized access, use, disclosure, disruption, modification, or destruction. This includes protecting against malware, viruses, and other cyber threats. Computer security is crucial in today's digital age, as it helps prevent identity theft, financial loss, and damage to reputation. It also ensures the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of data. Computer security measures include firewalls, antivirus software, encryption, and access controls. These measures help prevent cyber attacks and protect against data breaches. Computer security is an ongoing process that requires constant monitoring and updating to stay ahead of emerging threats. By implementing robust security measures, individuals and organizations can protect their digital assets and maintain trust with their customers and stakeholders.
