In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

From the lathe, the veneer is passed to the cutting table, where it is cut to lengths and widths as desired. It is then conveyed to the second story, where it is placed in large dry rooms, air tight, except as the air reaches them through the proper channels. The veneer is here placed in crates, each piece separate and standing on edge. The hot air is then turned on. This comes from the sheet iron furnace attached to the boiler in the engine room below, and is conveyed through large pipes regulated by dampers for putting on or taking off the heat. There is also a blower attached which keeps the hot air in the dry rooms in constant motion, the air as it cools passing off through an escape pipe in the roof, while the freshly heated air takes its place from below.

Prehistory was a time before written records. It is difficult to learn about the past without written information. However, archaeologists can study the remains of ancient buildings, tools, and artifacts. They learn about prehistory by examining the objects that were left behind. They help us understand ancient cultures.

Prehistory is the period of human history before written records existed. This era is marked by archaeological findings, artifacts, and oral traditions. The study of prehistory helps us understand ancient cultures, their tools, and their way of life, giving us a glimpse into a time without written documentation.

Prehistory began millions of years ago, before humans wrote. The earth’s climate changed. Volcanoes erupted, ice ages began and ended. Our ancestors roamed, hunting and gathering. They crafted tools and shelters. Their stories were passed on through gestures, sounds and art. The past shaped the present. We understand it through artifacts.  ​

‘Prehistory’ is the period before written records. Ancient humans lived in groups. They found food by hunting and gathering. Their tools were made from stone, wood, and bone. They had no writing to tell their stories. They communicated through images on rocks and cave walls. Their lives were marked by survival.

In a village dwelt a poor old woman, who had gathered together a dish of beans and wanted to cook them. So she made a fire on her hearth, and that it might burn the quicker, she lighted it with a handful of straw. When she was emptying the beans into the pan, one dropped without her observing it, and lay on the ground beside a straw, and soon afterwards a burning coal from the fire leapt down to the two. Then the straw began and said: ‘Dear friends, from whence do you come here?' The coal replied: ‘I fortunately sprang out of the fire, and if I had not escaped by sheer force, my death would have been certain, I should have been burnt to ashes.' The bean said: ‘I too have escaped with a whole skin, but if the old woman had got me into the pan, I should have been made into broth without any mercy, like my comrades.' ‘And would a better fate have fallen to my lot?' said the straw.

Prehistory is the period before writing existed. It is like the beans that were cooked and the straw that was burned, disappearing without a record. Then the coal and the bean, like the dry rooms, kept going, waiting for the hot air of knowledge to arrive, so their stories could be told.

However, the original paragraph was a bit wordy and used the wrong vocabulary. Here is a revised version that is more accurate and clear, but still targets the same readability level:

Prehistory is the time before people could write. It's like the beans that were cooked and the straw that was burned - gone without a record. Then the dry rooms, where the veneer was dried, came next, waiting for the hot air of discovery to arrive.

Prehistory is the time before recorded history. During that era, people didn’t have the tools or knowledge to leave a written record. They lived by hunting, gathering, and farming. They made tools from stone and wood, and wore clothes made from animal hides. They didn't have the technology we do today.  #prehistory #middle_school #readability_level_7_8 #short_paragraph

Did you know that the ancient people lived without writing tools? That's because it was prehistory, the time before recorded history. They hunted and gathered food and made tools from stone and wood. They wore clothes made from animal hides. Their way of life was much different from ours.  #prehistory #middle_school #readability_level_7_8 #short_paragraph
